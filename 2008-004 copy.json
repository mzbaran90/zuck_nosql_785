No (shaking her head), really no.\u201d  Both stories are good (Zuckerberg airy, chuckling) for me.  So, um (shot pause), so let\u2019s get into it.  (Smiling.)  [That\u2019s great.]  Let\u2019s get into the situation here at Facebook.  (Smiling and chuckling.)  First of all I have to say I- I\u2019m- I (quick pause) I promised that I would make this apology.  (Swallows.)  When I started writing about Facebook, when we started All Things D, I wanted to focus in on companies that I thought were really interesting, and one (1)  of the things that\u2019s great about the blogosphere is that you can truly obsess (emphasis) on people, like crazy.  At any time at night I can just [yeah] click away.  Yeah, you know about that.  [We\u2019ve noticed.]  Yeah, I know.  Um, so- a - and you can find people, and it\u2019s really fun that way.  And - and obsession is I- c it\u2019s working really well for me.  So (Audience and Sandberg laugh a little) what\u2019s interesting about it is that sometimes I go a little too far, it\u2019s the middle of the night, eh, you do not sleep when you blog, and you- especially when you have small children, um, and (pause) I - I called you something that I shouldn\u2019t have called you.  It was very funny as far as I was concerned.  I called you \u201cToddler CEO,\u201d um, it got on 60 Minutes, uh, Lacy Stahl was like, (\u201cimpersonation\u201d) \u201cSo you called him Toddler (emphasis) CEO?  What does that mean?\u201d  And I was like, \u201c Oh. (Rolls her eyes.)\u201d  And then I realized it was actually somewhat rude, and I should not have called you that.

You are twenty-three (23), (Zuckerberg smiling and laughing) twenty-four (24)?", "pos": 19}, {"speaker": "Mark Zuckerberg", "statement": "[2:10] I just turned twenty-four (24).

(Zuckerberg with a big smile and laughing.)  Uh, so I should call you (slight chuckle) \u201cToddler CEO,\u201d but it - it was funny.  (Inhales.)  Um, (Zuckerberg smiling; Zuckerberg, Audience, and Swisher laugh) but - but in the middle of the night I should resist that urge.  [Yeah.]  I have a lot of stuff I want to say in the middle of the night that I - that I do edit myself.  [Use the phone.]  Exactly.  I should you use the phone.  [You should use the phone.]  Let\u2019s get into, uh, Facebook.  Now i- i- why- one (1) of the reasons I do write about you so much is I find it a really intriguing and amazing (pause; inhales) company in a very short time (pause) creating and addressing a real problem that people have about (swallows; pause) their online presence, and I do believe (pause) that the reason I do focus on it is \u2018cause the promise is huge (emphasis), as far as I am concerned.  You\u2019re- and you\u2019re one (1) of the first companies, along with MySpace and all the other social networking sites, but especially Facebook (inhales) it\u2019s really captures people\u2019s attention of usefulness, utility, (inhales) online presence, and so that\u2019s why I- I\u2019m interested in it.  (Inhales.)  Um, let\u2019s get right into- I\u2019m going to get- I\u2019m going to talk to you, Sheryl about why you left Google, and what you\u2019re (pause) do-ing there.  Um, but u- u- Mark, talk a little bit about- you\u2019ve been written about a lot, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of attention.  What is (pause) Facebook right now?  How do you see it at this moment?  You\u2019ve talked about as a utility, you\u2019ve talked about it as lots of different things.  [Mhm.]  Define Facebook- (pause) J- Jerry was asked to define Yahoo!  (Pause.)  Whether he did so well [yeah] or not - or not.  How do you-\nPause.", "pos": 21}, {"speaker": "Mark Zuckerberg", "statement": "[3:21] (Inhales.)  So, I mean, Facebook is about helping people share information and share themselves.  [okay]  Right?  And for the last four (4) years (pause) what we\u2019ve been doing is just building projects that in different ways (quick pause; inhales) help people share different parts of their personality help them communicate [mhm], um, share parts of their identity with each other, and just open up.  And - and in a way that they\u2019re comfortable with [right], and there are a lot of important pieces to that that make that possible, so giving people complete control over their privacy.  Right?  And - and the information that they put out there.  [mhm]  (Inhales.)  So, and that\u2019s really critical in order to help people share that information.  [mhm]  (Inhales.)  But a lot of it is just building (short pause) different products that are different views on how people live and - and different parts of people\u2019s lives.  So, I mean (pause), early on we built this Photos application.  It was really widely used [right] and, um, and (pause) a - a lot of people used that to just, uh, kind of (pause) get a different view on (pause) on their friends and what other people around them.", "pos": 22}, {"speaker": "Kara Swisher", "statement": "[4:08] (Starts talking over Zuckerberg.)  Which people have been doing on the web.  They have been doing a different way.  I mean, it\u2019s not [yeah; pause; nodding] it\u2019s not the newest way.  But what is- what differentiates it?  Wha- what- how do you look at yourself in this special application vs- every single thing on Facebook is replicated somewhere else.  (Zuckerberg nods.)  How do you - how do you imagine that what you\u2019re doing is very different?  If at all-", "pos": 23}, {"speaker": "Mark Zuckerberg", "statement": "[4:25] (Inhales.)  Well, a lot of it is how - howit\u2019s tied together.  (Pause.)  Right, so (pause) people share information (short pause) and share part of themselves so that they can be shared with - with the specific people that they want to see it.  So we - we  have really good privacy settings so that people aren\u2019t sharing with the people that they don\u2019t want to [mhm], but because Facebook is this network and everyone\u2019s friends are there.  (Inhales.)  Um, people can effectively share the - the information, photos, blogs, videos (inhales), different parts of their identity, different information, status updates, whatever they want with people and those people will get it immediately.

I mean, I - I think, AOL was - was (starting to smile) definitely something that was interesting to me when I was in high school and-  [Okay; nods.]  Um, I remember (pause) some of my (pause) my early, um (pause), developing days were - were just kind of hacking different things on the AOL platform I - I don\u2019t even know if they called it a platform.  [okay]  But just different people would make stuff in chatrooms and - and things like that all the time, and it was interesting because a lot of my friends in high school [pause; mhm] also learned how to program and grew up (pause) by building thing on top of AOL and that\u2019s kind of interesting because a lot of people now are doing that on top of Facebook Platform.", "pos": 28}, {"speaker": "Kara Swisher", "statement": "[6:21] Right, exactly.

(Garbled speech.)  Um, what it was like to come to Silicon Valley.  You have instant attention right away.  (Emphasis; pause.)  That\u2019s a little bit daunting (pause) for anybody and daunting for someone who\u2019s young.  (Pause.)  What was- explain that phenomenon.

I mean, I (hesitation) just- I mean, I built Facebook with a couple of my roommates.  (Pause.)  Right?, at Harvard.  [mhm]  And early on we - we actually tapered the growth and kept it in by launching one (1) college at a time. [Pause; mhm.]  And once we go to about thirty (30) colleges (pause) and it was taking off at all of them.  We decided, \u201cOkay this is something that might be worth spending some time in.\u201d  And we decided to invest one (1) (emphasis) summer (pause) in it, and we wanted to get away from Harvard just \u2018cause a bunch of us had been there for [and so many people do, yeah] all (slight emphasis) of Freshman year.  Yeah (smiles), well, you know.  And, um-  [At least it would be a good plan, getting away from Harvard.]  Getting away from Harvard.  (Smiling; pause.)  Harvard was fun.

[Alright, go ahead.]  But, um, but anyhow, so - so [no I want to hear the funny story, Mark.  (Small airy laugh of disbelief.)]  Well this is a - this is a story too.  (Smiling.)  So - So [alright, okay] so we- (pause) answered (smiles) your original question.  [Alright.]  So, we, um, when we moved out to California just for the summer, and originally, I mean, we weren\u2019t think about starting a company or anything like that.  I remember explicitly thinking (short pause) that there are so many great companies our here and you drive down 101, right [mhm], and you see Yahoo! and all these great companies.  [mhm]  And, um (swallows; pause), I was thinking, you know, it would just be great to spend some time out here for the summer and get to know some of these companies (inhales; pause), and maybe one (1) day I\u2019ll - I\u2019ll build a company as a part of something, but - but this isn\u2019t that company.  [okay]  Um (scoffing laugh), [okay, not this] so, yeah, then, um, then at the end of, uh, (pause) a- at the end of that summer a bunch of us just ended up just staying out in California, and Harvard has this policy where you can take off as much time as you want and then go back whenever, so [short pause; mhm] we took off a term and then we took off another term and (pause) now we\u2019re here.

Actually it was - it was really funny listening to Bill yesterday talking about he never went to class.  Uh, [uh-huh], it - it reminded me of this story when- it was actually wo-one (1) of the w-one (1) of the applications that (pause) that I think is pretty similar to how people use Facebook to - to share information together, which is- (inhales) they - they have this core curriculum at Harvard, where you have to take certain types of classes [mhm] and they have this Lit and Arts requirement.  And I remember I was taking this class, The Rome of Augustus (pause), [mhm] where you had to (pause), um (pause), i- it was just all - all about art in the time of Augustus and Rome.  [mhm]  And, um (pause; swallows), I didn\u2019t go to class the whole term [okay], and then during reading period (pause) B- Bill was talking about ho- how he studied a lot and made up everything there and - and learned it before the final.  (Inhales.)  And, um (long pause), I was planning on doing that, but, instead (pause), that\u2019s (short pause) when we built Facebook [okay], so -so, I didn\u2019t really (Audience laughs; Zuckerberg smiles) so I didn\u2019t really have anytime then, so - so a few days before this class\u2019s final exam was going to be taking (pause), uh (looks up), I think it was some number of images from - from the class\u2019s artwork and being able to explain the historical significance of them.  So, I just went to the- went to the course website and downloaded all the images (pause) and made a little website where each one (1) of the images had its own page, and you could (pause) put, um (pause), a- and people could go and add comments to the page and [mhm] and explain what was going on.  And - and then I sent a link out to the classlist saying, \u201cHey I built a study tool.\u201d  (Smiling.)  And, um, (Audience, Sandburg and Swisher laughing hard; whistling) within-  (Stopped because of laughing.)  [[10:03] That is a funny story.]  So, with- within a half an hour it just- all - all the information of all the (Audience and Swisher laughing; Zuckerberg smiling) the pieces of artwork were there, and, um, and (pause) I - I think I- well I passed the course I don\u2019t remember what I got, but I remember the professor told me some time after that the course- that the grades on the final [right] were better than he expected them to be.", "pos": 38}, {"speaker": "Kara Swisher", "statement": "[10:20] Wow.

And people can argue- Keith here from Slide argues with me all the time about this, that I\u2019m no fun, and that\u2019s entirely true.

(Pause.)  Well, I mean, I think that there - there are two (2) things that I\u2019d say to that.  The first is that (pause) there probably are a bunch of applications that (pause) are useful in a more traditional sense.  I mean, there this Causes application that allows people to [it\u2019s very nice] to raise money for, you know, different fill and non-profit causes and raise awareness, and, I mean, that\u2019s a serious application.  Right?  [mhm]  It\u2019s doing serious good.  (Inhales; pause.)  And then there\u2019s this other trend on the internet, which is to just that utility and usefulness doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be this big thing anymore it can take place in - in a lot of little interactions.  [mhm]   Right, so a - a lot of what\u2019s happening on - on Facebook and trends on the web are, people post a little bit on content, but they do it more frequently.  Right, and we\u2019re seeing that with things like status updates they\u2019re just really short pieces of content.  Um, even (pause) people uploading photos (short pause) that people more likely now (emphasis; short pause; inhales through nose) to upload things like a mobile photo.  One (1) mobile photo.  [mhm]  Right then they - they were before.  This - this trend is toward much smaller more frequent updates.  Right?  [right]  And that\u2019s how people are sharing themselves online.  [right]  So, I mean, so a lot of these other things that (pause) that you - you might look at and - and traditionally say don\u2019t look like Microsoft Word or Excel [right] can still be really useful.

Someone knows what they are looking for they can get it.  We knew we wanted a princess phone once we heard about it this morning.  [okay]  We did a search, we found it, it was a target-  [Where\u2019d you search?]  Uh, I didn\u2019t do it.  We had someone do it.  (Zuckerberg laughs.)  But probably Google.  ([Alright]; Zuckerberg laughing.)  I hope Google.  (Smiles and laughs; inhales.)  I still remain loyal.  But (pause), you know, we knew what we were doing.  It was demand fulfillment.  But a larger part of what is advertising spending all over the world is in demand generation, traditional brand spending.  ([Right]; inhales.)  And the question there is, \u201cHow do you capture people\u2019s attention and engage and involve?\u201d  Even when they don\u2019t know what they are looking for.  (Inhales.)  And one (1) of the reasons I came to Facebook (pause) was because I think Facebook has a really unique opportunity to fulfill that (emphasis) vision and fulfill that mission.  (Inhales.)  So our users tell us a lot about themselves [mhm], and they\u2019re telling us what they like, what they don\u2019t like, what they do.  And that gives us an opportunity to provide- to work with advertisers to provide them information that\u2019s actually useful.  (Inhales.)  And, you know, everyone talks about targeting, and everyone (quick pause) tries [privacy] to work on it.  We\u2019re working on it too, and privacy.  And, of course, we mean it in a (pause), you know totally anonymous way, but do we think we can use what we know, work with users to pro- use advertisers to provide things that are great for you users.  Absolutely.  (Inhales.)  But I think (pause) we have a s-econd (pause) level, which we can do.  Which is, we think we can offer real engagement.  (Pause.)  So, the dream (emphasis) of advertisers is to (pause) create demand for something, and then let people engage with the products.  So, I\u2019ll share one (1) example.  (Pause.)  Uh, end of April Ben & Jerry\u2019s does their free cone day [mhm].  I guess they do it once a year, or so.  (Inhales.)  And they did an advertising campaign with us.  Where we have these free gif- these sponsored gifts, and they sponsored the gift.  And they gave out two hundred and fifty thousand (250,000) cones, which means users without paying a dollar could give cones to each other.  ([Mhm]; inhales.)  So within a couple of hours two hundred and fifty thousand (250,000) cones were given out.  So Ben & Jerry\u2019s bought another two hundred and fifty thousand (250,000) cones.  So, within eleven (11) hours five hundred thousand (500,000) people had sent these free cones.  (Inhales; pause.)  There was also a link to the Ben & Jerry\u2019s store locator where it told everyone, \u201cToday is Ben & Jerry\u2019s free cone day.  (Short pause.)  You can come.\u201d  And people used our Events page to say, \u201cOh I\u2019m doing this,\u201d and invite each other.  (Inhales.)  By the time this was done within twenty-four (24) hours, we think there was something like fifty-three (53) million impressions (pause) on Ben & Jerry\u2019s.  [mhm]  Users telling Ben & Jerry\u2019s on their page what kind of flavors they like.  People telling each other they were going to cone day.  (Inhales; facial expression; pause.)  I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you all the advertising on Facebook has that property because (pause; [no]) we both know they don\u2019t.  [For me, for some reason, it\u2019s viagra.]  You\u2019ll skewer me.  Yeah, we know that.  We know that.  But that is the vision. [mhm]  And that\u2019s a pretty Facebook unique opportunity.
