            "statement": "Thanks, Deborah. And thanks everyone for joining today.\nThis was another good quarter and a good end to 2016. Our community continues to grow, and now with nearly 1.9 billion people using Facebook every month and more than 1.2 billion using it every day. We've seen continued growth and engagement on our platform, and our ads business is doing well, too. Total revenue grew by 51% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, and advertising revenue was up 53% to $8.6 billion.\nFacebook stands for connecting people and creating a global community, and in 2016 more people than ever made their voices heard. We saw billions of conversations about everything from important\nelections to the Olympics to breaking news stories around the world. And more people are taking advantage of new tools to connect and share on our family of apps -- especially with video.\n2016 was also a year that reinforced the importance of connecting the world.\nToday is the five-year anniversary of the day we filed to go public. In our letter to potential shareholders, I wrote that \"There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future.\" I believe that now more than ever. And as the largest global community, I see our responsibility as very important, and we will continue to focus on doing everything we can to bring the world closer together.\nI want to give you an update on our progress over our 3, 5 and 10-year time horizons with a particular focus on what we're going to be doing over the next three years.\nI've said before that I see video as a mega trend on the same order as mobile. That's why we're going to keep putting video first across our family of apps and making it easier for people to capture and share video in new ways.\nTo make it easier to find and watch videos, we've added a tab at the bottom of the Facebook app with top videos and recommendations. We've already rolled the tab out to everyone in the U.S., and we're planning to bring it to more countries soon.\nWe're also improving live video as more people use it. New Year's Eve was our biggest live moment ever, with more people going live than at any other time since we launched the product. We're experimenting with live 360 video, audio-only live for people with slower connections, and live face masks and more camera effects and we'll have more updates soon.\nFinally, we're looking for ways to grow the ecosystem of video content on Facebook. We want people to think of Facebook as a place for interesting and relevant video content from professional creators as well as their friends. Last year we started to invest in more original video content to help seed the ecosystem, and we\u2019re planning to do more in 2017.\nWe're also focused on building a more informed community.\nWe see Facebook as a community, and ourselves, our role, as supporting that community. We don't write the news that you read, but we want to be a place where people can access information and have meaningful conversations, and this is a responsibility that we take very seriously.\nIn the past we\u2019ve taken steps to reduce spam and clickbait, and now we're approaching misinformation and hoaxes the same way. In Q4, we started working with third-party fact-checkers in the U.S. to flag disputed stories and make them less likely to appear in News Feed. We've made it easier to report and identify misinformation. And we're working to build stronger ties between Facebook and the news industry.\nOur primary goal here is to do the right thing for our community. If we can help people stay informed and make Facebook a better place to understand what's going on in the world, then we think that's going to make our community stronger and a more positive force for good in the world.\nSo that's the 3-year update. Over the next five years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around our apps that a lot of people are already using.\nGrowth and engagement on Instagram have been strong. We announced in December that Instagram now has over 600 million monthly actives and recently passed 400 million daily actives. Instagram Stories reached 150 million daily actives just five months after the launch, and we've added new features like Boomerang and Live into Stories and I'm excited to see that continue to grow.\nOur messaging services are making good progress as well. In Q4, Messenger launched a new camera, group video chat for up to 50 people, and games. 400 million people now use voice and video chat on Messenger every month.\nWhatsApp is growing quickly, too. We recently reached 1.2 billion monthly actives and more than 50 billion messages are sent through WhatsApp every day. In the last quarter we also added the ability to make video calls in the app.\nOver the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in these platforms and technologies that will give more people a voice and make sharing even more immersive.\nThrough our efforts with Internet.org, we have now connected more than 50 million people to the internet. And in November, our connectivity lab set a world record by transmitting 20 GBPS over 13 kilometers using the same amount of power it takes to light a single lightbulb. Ultimately, this technology is going to make it into the solar-powered planes that we're building to beam internet to parts of the world that aren't connected.\nOn artificial intelligence, we developed a new technique called \"style transfer\" that uses AI to study a painting and then can take your photos or videos and draw them in that style in real time on your phone. And if you post on Facebook looking for a place to eat or suggestions for where to go, we can now use AI to understand the text of your post and understand what you're asking and surface recommendations from the comments.\nWe're still early in our 10-year plan for virtual reality, but we've made some good progress. In December, we shipped our Touch controllers, and the community response has been very positive. Samsung announced that they've now shipped more than 5 million Gear VRs. And we're bringing more social experiences to VR with apps like Oculus Rooms for Gear VR. We're going to keep making big investments in VR content, and I'm excited about what's coming in 2017 -- from new games to more immersive educational experiences.\nAs I said on our call last quarter, we're going to continue to invest and hire aggressively -- to help improve our products, but also to build the infrastructure that will help us grow in the future. A few weeks ago I visited our newest data center in Fort Worth, Texas. It's going to be the biggest data center we've built, powered by 100% renewable energy, and it's a great example of the investments that we're making to help us serve our community even better.\nSo we've made some good progress, but we have a lot more to do to help bring the world together. I want to thank our community, our teams, our partners, and all of you for being a part of this journey with us.\nNow, here's Sheryl.",

            "statement": "Thanks Mark and hi everyone.\nWe had a strong fourth quarter capping off a great 2016.\nQ4 ad revenue grew 53%. Mobile ad revenue reached $7.2 billion, up 61% year-over-year, and was approximately 84% of total ad revenue. Our growth this quarter was broad-based across all regions, marketer segments, and verticals.\nWe\u2019re really excited to announce today that 65 million businesses are using our free Facebook Pages product and 5 million are using Instagram Business profiles. More and more of these businesses are becoming advertisers with over 4 million advertising on Facebook and over 500,000 on Instagram. As a result, our revenue base is becoming more diverse. In Q4, our top 100 advertisers represented less than a quarter of our ad revenue, which is a decline from Q4 last year.\nWe continue to focus on our three priorities \u2013 capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.\nFirst - capitalizing on the shift to mobile.\nIn Q4, we saw consumers use mobile for more of their holiday shopping. ComScore found that mobile drove over a billion dollars in total Cyber Monday sales for the first time ever.\nMarketers are increasingly seeing mobile as an opportunity it is. In 2016, we saw more marketers prioritizing mobile and especially mobile video.\nPeople consume video differently on mobile so the best marketers are optimizing their creative. For example, Hershey\u2019s used Facebook Live and Video ads for the launch of their Cookie Layer Crunch. They optimized their Video Ads to grab attention in the first few seconds and used captions for people viewing without sound. Nielsen Brand Effect measured an 11pt lift in brand awareness, and a 20pt lift in ad recall.\nWe are helping more businesses connect with more people on mobile, both on Facebook and off. Last month, we announced that advertisers can reach over one billion people a month on the Audience Network.\nOur second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products.\nIt\u2019s clear that businesses of all sizes are using our platforms to reach customers.\nTwo weeks ago, I visited Holzconnection, a family-run furniture maker in Berlin. When competition increased several years ago, the owner worried he might have to close stores. His son joined the family business and convinced his father to market on Facebook. Holzconnection didn\u2019t change anything about their traditional craft, just the way they reached customers. Since then, they\u2019ve opened 5 new locations both domestically and internationally. We want to help more small businesses grow, so we\u2019ve invited companies including Holzconnection to participate in Small Business Councils around the world.\nWe continue to invest in making our free and paid products easier to use \u2013 expanding our online tutorials and offering creative tools to businesses of all sizes. For example, the owners of Distinctive Gardens \u2013 a gardening center in Illinois \u2013 watched one of our online tutorials and then used a mobile phone to shoot a holiday-themed video. They sold out their holiday inventory.\nOur third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective.\nOur goal is to drive value for our clients. As we grow the diversity of businesses on our platform, we\u2019ve invested in building ad products that meet a broad set of objectives \u2013 from building brands to moving products off shelves online and in-stores. To make our ad products as relevant and effective as possible, we\u2019re increasingly tailoring them by vertical.\nIn 2016 we invested in Dynamic Ads, which allow advertisers to automatically promote products from their entire catalog. We expanded Dynamic Ads across Facebook, Instagram, and the Audience Network and tailored them for verticals like travel and retail. Dynamic Ads for Travel enable businesses to show ads based on dates and destinations people are interested in, while Dynamic Ads for Retail show people the products available at nearby locations in real-time. Last month we introduced Dynamic Ads for Broad Audiences to help businesses reach new customers based on their interests on Facebook and online behavior. We\u2019ll continue to work on building effective ad products and proving the value they drive.\nWe know that measurement is important to building advertiser trust. Last year, we discovered several metrics issues. While no billable metrics were affected, we took action to fix the errors and reviewed all of our metrics. We also expanded our partnerships with third parties given the important role they play in verification. We\u2019ll continue to invest in measurement, including third party partnerships, in the upcoming year.\nWe believe our strong 2016 is because of the value we drove for businesses on our platforms. We\u2019re inspired by the entrepreneurs we work with, like the owners of Holzconnection and Distinctive Gardens, and we\u2019re grateful for the opportunity to help them reach customers, grow their businesses, and hire more people.\nWith only a small fraction of the businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we know we have a lot of opportunity and hard work ahead. In 2017, we\u2019ll stay focused on helping businesses of all sizes reach customers around the world and grow\nThanks, and now here's Dave.",

            "statement": "Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone.\n2016 was another year of strong, profitable growth, and we continued to invest in building our business for the long-term. Full-year 2016 revenue was $27.6 billion and grew 54% or 56% on a constant currency basis, and we generated over $10 billion in GAAP net income.\nLet\u2019s start with our community metrics.\nIn December, 1.23 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 189 million or 18% compared to last year. 1.86 billion people used Facebook during the month of December, up 269 million or 17% compared to last year.\nIn addition to our ongoing Internet.org and Android product efforts, we benefitted from an increase in third party promotional free data plans in Asia and the Rest of World.\nMobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.15 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in December, up 212 million or 23% compared to last year.\nGiven that the vast majority of monthly and daily usage now occurs on mobile devices, my comments will focus on total MAU and DAU beginning next quarter, and we do not plan to include mobile and mobile-only usage breakdowns in our supplemental investor materials after this quarter.\nTurning now to the financials.\nMy prepared remarks will focus on our GAAP results unless otherwise noted. As I have noted before, we focus on GAAP results because stock-based compensation plays an important role in how employees are compensated in our business and industry more broadly, and we view it as a real expense.\nQ4 total revenue was $8.8 billion, up 51%. Q4 ad revenue was $8.6 billion, up 53% or 54% on a constant currency basis.\nMobile ad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 61%, and represented approximately 84% of total ad revenue. Desktop ad revenue grew 22%, despite a decline in desktop usage, helped by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertisements served on personal computers.\nThe same supply and demand factors we have discussed in the past continue to drive our mobile ads revenue.\nOn the demand side, we continued to improve our targeting, measurement, and ad formats to drive strong results for marketers. As Sheryl mentioned, these efforts are working for an increasingly broad set of advertisers.\nOn the supply side, growth in users, time spent, and ad load also contributed to our strong results.\nIn Q4, the average price per ad increased 3% and the total number of ad impressions served increased 49%, driven primarily by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.\nPayments & Other Fees revenue was $180 million, down 12%.\nQ4 total expenses were $4.2 billion, up 29%.\nWe ended the year with approximately 17,000 employees, up 34% compared to last year and an increase from the 31% growth rate last quarter.\nQ4 operating income was $4.6 billion, representing a 52% margin. Our tax rate was 21%.\nNote that our tax rate reflects our early adoption of a new accounting standard -- ASU 2016-9. Under this standard, the tax benefit related to the difference between the vesting price and the grant price of RSUs is now reflected in our income tax provision, whereas previously it was reflected as an adjustment to equity. This is purely an accounting convention change and does not change the cash taxes we pay.\nExcluding the impact of this new standard, our Q4 GAAP tax rate would have been approximately 26% and in-line with the guidance we provided on the Q3 call.\nNet income was $3.6 billion or $1.21 per share.\nFull-year 2016 capital expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, up 78%, as we continue to invest to support the rapid growth of the business around the world. Over the course of 2016, we expanded four of our existing data centers and began construction of four new data centers.\nIn 2016, we generated over $11.6 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with $29.4 billion in cash and investments.\nAlso note that the new accounting standard changed how we present operating cash flow and the free cash flow calculation. In the past, we treated the excess tax benefit as a financing cash flow item and thus was not included in either cash flow metric.\nAdoption of this standard also resulted in a retrospective adjustment to certain 2016 quarterly financial line items. For more detail on these adjustments, please refer to the supplemental earnings slides available on our investor website.\nTurning now to the outlook.\nFirst, on revenue, the outlook is unchanged. Consistent with my comments on the Q3 call, we continue to expect that our ad revenue growth rate will come down meaningfully in 2017. The factors driving this expectation remain the same.\nWe also expect that our full-year 2017 Payments & Other Fees revenue will decline compared to full-year 2016.\nSecond, on expenses. Consistent with what I said last quarter, we expect that 2017 will be an aggressive investment year.\nWe saw hiring growth accelerate in Q4 and we plan to accelerate hiring further in 2017 from that 34% growth rate. In addition to headcount, we expect to increase investments in R&D, content, sales and marketing and other areas as we execute on our near, medium and long-term priorities.\nWe expect that full-year 2017 total GAAP expenses will grow 40%-50% compared to the full-year 2016.\nWe anticipate that full-year 2017 share-based compensation expenses will be in the range of $3.9-$4.1 billion, approximately $1.3 billion of which is related to acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We also expect full-year 2017 amortization expenses to be approximately $700-$800 million.\nAccordingly, on a non-GAAP basis, we would expect total expenses to grow approximately 47-57% compared to the full year 2016. We anticipate our expense growth rates will increase over the course of the year.\nWe expect our full-year 2017 capital expenditures will be in the range of $7-$7.5 billion as we fund the expansion of data center capacity and office facilities to support the continued rapid growth of our business.\nTurning now to tax. At current stock prices, we expect that our full-year 2017 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates will be one to two percentage points lower than our respective 2016 tax rates. Let me note two additional factors with the new standard. First, our tax rate will vary based on the stock price. And secondly, we anticipate the tax rate will start lower in Q1 and then trend up throughout the year.\nBefore wrapping up, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter our board of directors authorized a $6 billion stock repurchase program beginning in 2017 with no fixed expiration date.\nOur main priority is to invest aggressively to grow the business while maintaining a strong cash position. At this time, the company\u2019s strong balance sheet and financial performance puts us in a position to\nmake opportunistic repurchases of our common stock from time to time to help offset the dilution incurred through equity issuance.\nTo conclude, 2016 was a strong year for Facebook in terms of community growth, engagement, product innovation and the growth of our advertising business. We believe we have significant opportunities ahead of us as we invest in our mission to make the world more open and connected.\nWith that, operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.",

There is the type of content that people produce socially for friends. There's promotional content that businesses and celebrities and folks will produce.\nBut there's also a whole class of premium content that the creators need to get paid a good amount in order to support the creation of that content and we need to be able to support that with a business model which we're working on through ads to fund that.\nSo the biggest change that I think that we're going to see on the consumption in news feed and in the tab over the next year or two is going to be much more video inventory and content coming in as we work through and make that business model start to really click for a lot of folks.\nOver the longer term, I think as that works people will experiment with longer form of video as well and all kinds of different things. But that I think is the primary focus for the foreseeable future.",

And how do you think about that evolving over time and the monetization of Instagram evolving over time?\nThe second one, just to go back to Doug's question on the content -- Dave, you mentioned content spend as being part of the investment.

I think a lot of this comes down to the graphs in the community that you have in the different places; Instagram is a follow model. Right? So it\u2019s -- they're not all bidirectional friendships. A larger portion of the content is public content.\nMore of the content is visual, whereas Facebook has a mix of text and news and links and visual content like photos and videos. And Instagram creates a pure experience that's focused on photos and videos. All of those good and subtle decisions that Kevin has made over the years add up to creating a different kind of community that what we're finding -- and that's great -- is that it's really complementary to what people are doing on Facebook.\nAnd some of what we found is that as we encourage people to use both Facebook and Instagram, engagement on both can increase. So that is great and that I think speaks to how you can build these different kinds of communities with different connections in a way that really is creating new value in people's lives.",

            "statement": "On the video ad opportunity, we're seeing consumer video exploding on our platform as Mark has talked about. And that really creates the opportunity for video ads in the feed and a lot of this happens within the current news feed\nproduct. People post videos, people consume news feed Stories, those Stories include video stories from consumers and then we have an opportunity to serve ads.\nAs consumer video has grown in news feed it's given us that opportunity for video ads because the format of the ads fits the format of what consumers are doing. And we're seeing a lot of great examples of people using ads in the feed across Instagram and news feed.\nIn terms of monetizing some of our newer attempts at products and news feeds such as ad breaks, those are really in early experimental stages and for now we\u2019re really focused primarily on our core business \u2013 our core ads product -- of which video is one.\nOne of the things that's really important in this is helping marketers understand that they need to optimize those video ads. That an ad that works really well 30 seconds in other platforms \u2013 and more traditional platforms can work on ours -- but the ones that are optimized and use our targeting really perform better. And we're working hard with advertisers to help them see that.\nSo to share one example, Motorola working with Ogilvy and Moto-mento launched the Moto Z phone. And they did awareness boosting before they launched, targeting Android users and Verizon subscribers and they optimized their video for the Facebook and Instagram mobile feeds.\nAfter they launched they did purchasing ads and retargeted people who had viewed those initial ads. That's just a great example of someone using video ads, optimizing the format but also using the pretty unique targeting we can offer to drive sales. They measured that they had over a 3.5 percent lift in sales driven by the Facebook and Instagram video ads.\nAnd so we're pretty excited about the opportunity we have in our current business and we're going to work client by client to get the video format of those ads right, get the targeting to be as good and as deep as it can be and make sure we're measuring all the way through to sales.",

            "statement": "And Eric, you were asking about content and where that's going to get picked up in the P&L. There's no real simple answer on that. I would say in general where we're going to be rev sharing with creators, that's going to be picked up in cost of revenue. So that's probably the simplest answer.\nBut as we do \u2013 as we do arrangements to get the ecosystem going, some of that could get picked up in sales and marketing. And then we have content as well that\u2019s getting picked up in R&D for the efforts we're making with Oculus.\nSo you're seeing some of those get spread across several different lines in the P&L.

Your reported pricing metric, I realize there's typically been noise in that -- I think it's up 3% year on year -- first of all, is that sort of representative for general pricing changes in the marketplace and do you think there's still room for upside in pricing? And if so, where are some of the key areas where you see that coming from?\nAnd then another question on video -- as you\u2019ve begun to push more video content to users within the Facebook app itself, are you witnessing any meaningful changes in engagement time spent with a typical Facebook app user?\nThank you.",

There's lots of different underlying metrics. But the overall kind of reported metric is really -- continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right-hand column ads which are lower price and lower value.\nAnd then obviously impression growth is driven by the users\u2019 time spent in ad load. In terms of the opportunities for price, it's really just continuing to focus on making our ads better targeted, more relevant, improving all the different ways in which we can drive better outcomes for our advertisers and sort of meeting them with the results that they care about and delivering those results.\nWe think there\u2019s \u2013 continue to be great opportunities to do that and how the supply-demand dynamics play out will kind of impact the overall direction of price. And it's going to depend obviously also on regional mixes too. Some regions have obviously lower prices.\nI think the other question was on video. Video's one of the big drivers of engagement growth on Facebook. It's also helpful on Instagram where we're also seeing the benefit of ranking changes. So we continue to see good engagement and time spent growth across the Facebook family and on just Facebook and video is a part of that story. So it's an important part of that story.",

We're now per month at a billion messages sent between people and businesses and we think that's very promising for our ability for people to use this platform to make those connections that will ultimately drive business opportunities.\nWe're in the very early stages; some of those ads you're seeing are the exploring how to build more of these connections.

            "speaker": "Mark Zuckerberg",
            "statement": "I'll take Messenger and WhatsApp, then you can take ad load.\nSo, yes is the basic answer, that Messenger and WhatsApp serve somewhat different utilities for people. WhatsApp really takes the place of SMS in a lot of the markets where it operates. It\u2019s \u2013 the graph is based on phone numbers, you're as likely to text your barber or someone that you're going to transact with who you would have a phone number with as you would be a friend.\nWhereas on Facebook Messenger the graph is your friends and you're more likely to, say, wish an acquaintance Happy Birthday on Facebook Messenger than on WhatsApp, where you might not have their phone number in the first place.\nSo, you can think about some overlap in the core use case. You might message your close friends and family on either. But what we\u2019ve found in general is that if you look at some of the markets that are strongest for both of them, they could each grow in those markets. And as messaging has become more affordable and more reliable for people, the volumes of messaging have just gone through the roof in terms of what people want to do.\nLooking at -- my understanding from looking at a bunch of analytics is that the peak of global SMS reached somewhere in the low 20 billion messages per day and we already have many times more than that \u2013 three-times-or-more -- more than that across WhatsApp and Messenger and of course there are other messaging products in the world besides these as well. We're pretty confident that this is going to keep on growing.\nI do think to your point that the monetization paths are going to be somewhat different reflecting the difference in product philosophy. Messenger is much more focused on being an expressive and rich environment that has lots of different types of content. Kind of more like Facebook to the Instagram example that we used before, whereas WhatsApp I think is the much more utilitarian experience with a \u2013 with a much more stark UI where there's just not as much emphasis on having a lot of different ways to engage.\nSo we did the experiment that you asked about before around ads in Messenger and different ways to -- that businesses can interact. And there\u2019s a lot of flexibility around how we can explore there, which is why I think you\u2019ll see some more of that on the Messenger side than on the WhatsApp side in the near time.\nBut giving businesses the opportunity to connect in WhatsApp and reach the people that they want and eventually have increasingly -- hopefully transactional interactions -- I think will be a really useful thing on that platform as well.",

Instagram is growing quicker on a percentage basis but it's much smaller.\nThe ad load opportunities are higher on Instagram because Instagram is at a lower ad load than Facebook so there is an opportunity for us to continue to grow ad load on Instagram probably beyond -- in a longer time frame than there is on Facebook because of that disparity in terms of where they are today.\nBut given the scale of Facebook and the importance of driving overall revenue, that's why I\u2019ve continued to express what our expectations are for advertising\ngrowth in 2017 and the reduction in the growth rate that we expect, given the potential to grow ad load on Facebook that we expect to come down in 2017.",

And when you see platform shifts as you are in the ad market for more traditional forms of media -- to display, to now mobile -- we're seeing those metrics change. And there's obviously a lot of conversation and a lot of concern out there about what we're measuring.\nWe think the answer to all of this is to remember that what really matters is going all the way through from the ad itself to the sale -- whether that sale is online or offline. And we are working hard to work on the data in a privacy protective way to be able to do that. And we're making progress across verticals across our large customers.\nI don't have the percentage of exactly how many customers are working on this type of measurement with us; it's certainly growing. It's certainly something we're working on vertical by vertical. But it has really important impacts -- not just in their ability to serve the right ad to the right person at the right time -- but also their ability to optimize their ads for our format.\nThat once they understand what's really moving their products off shelves online and off, that's where we get to the real work we need to do to optimize the ad and really work on the targeting. And so I remain very optimistic. We have a lot of hard work to do to get to all of our ad campaigns having that kind of measurement; that\u2019s going to take a long time.\nBut the more we can do it even in studies with each client, the better \u2013 the better our ads get.",

So there are a few types of systems here that we're working on around understanding content.\nOne is around visual content and the other is about language. For visual content, we want to be able to look at a photo and understand what's in it, right? And whether that's something that you're going to be interested in, right?\nAnd similarly, we went to be able to look at a video and watch it and understand whether that's something that you're going to be interested in. And you can imagine that today we consider putting things in your news feed that you're connected to in some way, right? That are from a friend or a page that you're following or that one of your friends likes.\nBut there's no reason that we shouldn't be able to match you up with any of the millions of pieces of content that you might be interested in that get shared on Facebook every day except for the fact that we don't have the AI \u2013 the AI technology to know what those are about and that they match your interests today.\nSo a combination of being able to understand the texts that people message, read the articles that people would want to look at, watch the videos, look at the photos -- are going to be great too.\nAnother area where I'm really excited about this is our ability to keep the community safe. So there's an increasing focus on objectionable content. And a lot of unfortunate things that people share on Facebook. It's a minority of the content but I'm really focused on making sure our company gets faster at taking the bad stuff down.\nAnd we can do better with people but ultimately the best thing we can do is build AI systems that can watch a video and understand that it's going to be problematic and violates the policies of our community and that people aren't going to want to see it and then just not show it to people. Before bad experiences happen and things like violence get spread through -- violent content gets spread through the network.\nI think it\u2019s both going to be \u2013 AI is both going to be great on showing people content that's really good and helping us enforce the community standards that we have to make sure that everyone has a good and fair experience.",

That's a pretty different intent than how people come to Facebook today.\nToday for the most part people pull Facebook out when they have a few minutes, when they want to catch up and see what\u2019s going on in the world, with their friends and in the news and everything that\u2019s going on. That's very different from saying, hey, I want to watch video content now. And that's what I think we're going to unlock with this tab.\nSo all of the content that is on Facebook is eligible to go in the tab. We\u2019re -- I mean, we're showing video content; not all the rest of it. But there isn't a concrete difference between what could be a news feed and what could be here. Just that the experience is designed to deliver on that promise of, you want to watch videos, you want to keep up with the content that you watch episodically, week over week; this is going to be the place where you go to do that.\nI do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here. Because a lot of the best episodic content is professionally created and those folks need to make a good amount of money in order to support their business model. So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience.\nBut that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take this to the next level. The early trends are good but I think this is really going to be an area that is proportional to the amount of quality content that is in the system and the business model is really going to be the thing that enables that.",

I think that there are parts of this that are on a good trajectory and parts where we're a little behind where we would want to be. If you\u2019d \u2013 I think Samsung shipping 5 million Gear VRs \u2013 I mean, that's their product and not ours \u2013 but we build technology that powers it. I think that's quite a good result, right?\nAnd one that we're very happy with and just shows how strong of a company Samsung is, being able to build these products and sell them through and into the world.\nOn our \u2013 on the side of the products that we built -- Rift and Touch were both a little delayed; that was obviously somewhat of a disappointment. If you want to accelerate development \u2013 and obviously we need to get our product in the market at a good pace \u2013 but in terms of the content development, I actually think that that's coming at a reasonable clip.\nEarly on there is this issue which is that if you're a AAA game developer, until there's a certain volume of units in the field, you're not going to be able to make enough money to fund your game development just based off of people buying your content. That's why we're investing so much capital in content to seed the ecosystem and solve this chicken and egg problem, of you need the content in order to create the ecosystem.\nBut I don't think that there is really a strategy to pull this in from ten years to five; I just think it's going to be a 10 year thing. The analogy I always use, the first Smartphones came out in 2013 \u2013 sorry \u2013 2003 -- the Blackberry and Palm Treo. And it took 10 years to get to a billion units.\nI don't know there was something that folks could have done to make that happen fast but I think that was pretty good. And if we can be on a similar trajectory of anywhere near 10 years for VR and AR, then I would feel very good about that. And I feel like we're making the right bets now to plant the seeds for that. But I would ask for the patience of the investor community in doing that because we're going to invest a lot in this and it's not going to return or be really profitable for us for quite a while.",

Is that working on Facebook? You've experimented. You\u2019ve experimented with NBA games on Facebook outside the US \u2013 NBA D League on Facebook \u2013 so just wanted to get your thoughts on how those have gone?\nThanks a lot.",
