            "statement": "We stopped by the University of Alabama and sat down with Coach Saban. We talked about what it takes to build a world class football organization. Many of the same things go into building a good company and a winning football program -- a focus on recruiting, developing talent and setting high expectations.\n\nWe also got lunch with some of the Alabama Football players who come from all over the country to be part of this program. We talked about about the pressures of being a student athlete -- not only the personal pressure of achieving their goals of making it to the NFL, but also having the hopes of their community ride of their success.\n\nWe all need to be part of something bigger than ourselves. Communities can form around all kinds of things -- churches, schools, teams -- and it's clear that for a lot of folks in Alabama, college football is an important part of their community.",
