But what we saw, before the election, was this Russian hacking group, part of Russian military intelligence, that I guess our government calls APT28. They were trying to do more traditional methods of hacking: Phishing people\u2019s accounts, just getting access to people\u2019s accounts that way.\nWe identified this, actually, in the middle of 2015 and notified the FBI. When we saw similar activity through the campaign in 2016, that they were trying to phish people\u2019s accounts in both the DNC and RNC, we notified some of the people over there as well, [who] we thought were at risk.\nWe, around the time of the election, had given this context to the FBI. They\u2019ve clearly gone much further now, at this point, in terms of putting the whole story together. You could see that in the indictments that Mueller just issued over the last week or so. That\u2019s the part that I actually think we got, and were on top of.\nNow, there\u2019s a whole other area of election interference that we were slower to identify. That\u2019s around the coordinated information operations that they were trying to run, and that was a different group. Instead of APT28, that was this group, IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which basically was just setting up a network of fake accounts, in order to spread divisive information.",

Divisive information.\nOnce we became aware of this \u2014 which we think we were too slow to being on top of that, but once we became aware of this \u2014 we developed this whole roadmap and set of techniques to go and handle that type of security threat in addition to the type of phishing and more traditional cyber attacks that we had seen before. That takes us through all the elections that we have seen since then. There\u2019s the French presidential election, the German election, the Alabama special election, the Mexican election recently, and there were elections all around the world.\nNow the playbook is: We build AI tools to go find these fake accounts, find coordinated networks of inauthentic activity and take them down; we make it much harder for anyone to advertise in ways that they shouldn\u2019t be. A lot of tools around ad transparency, to make it so that anyone who is advertising, especially around political issue ads, will have a lot of the information, a very high standard of transparency. Higher than what you have in TV or print, or other kinds of ads there.",

We found that and notified both the government and the people who were at risk, but there\u2019s no doubt we were too slow to identify this new kind of attack, which was a coordinated online information operation.\nYou can bet that that\u2019s now a big focus of the security effort that we have here. We\u2019re very focused on making sure that we get this right, not just broadly, but in all the elections that are coming up. 2018 is an incredibly important election year, not just with the important midterms here in the U.S., but you just had the Mexican elections. You have Brazil. You have India coming up at the beginning of next year. There\u2019s an assortment of elections around the EU. We\u2019re very serious about this.

I think now we understand that, given where we are, both the centrality of Facebook, but also, frankly, we\u2019re a profitable enough company to have 20,000 people go work on reviewing content, so I think that means that we have a responsibility to go do that. That\u2019s a different position than we were in five or six years ago, or even when we went public and were a meaningfully smaller company at that point.\nI do think it\u2019s fair to say that we were probably\u2026 we were too focused on just the positives and not focused enough on some of the negatives. That said, I don\u2019t want to leave the impression that we didn\u2019t care about security or didn\u2019t have thousands of people working on it before then. This was a new thing.\nI think we have a lot of responsibility. The community, more than two billion people use our products, and we get that with that, a lot of people are using that for a lot of good, but we also have a responsibility to mitigate the darker things that people are gonna try to do.",

            "speaker": "Mark Zuckerberg",
            "statement": "I think that that is still a good description. In general, we\u2019re a social network. I prefer that because I think it is focused on the people part of it \u2014 as opposed to some people call it social media, which I think focuses more on the content. For me, it\u2019s always been about the people, and the reason why I called it a utility was because a lot of people used to think of it as a fad. What I was trying to communicate was, no, building a network and building relationships is one of the most core things that people do, and that is an enduring utility that people need, that is not a fad. The company shouldn\u2019t be run to try to build something that is cool, it should be run to build something that is useful and enduring. And I still believe that.\nWhen I think about what social networking should be... now you\u2019ve mapped out all of the people who a person cares about. What are all the useful things that you can do for people on top of that? So I think about things like Marketplace, that we\u2019re doing, that now people can have trust through their network and can basically go and buy and sell things more easily than they would be able to on other services.\nOther examples are things like Safety Check. There are disasters that happen \u2014 Hurricane Harvey came up, and you had people self-organizing through the community and getting in boats and driving around rescuing people coordinated ad hoc through this network. That\u2019s not a media function. That\u2019s a social network of people coming together ad hoc to provide safety infrastructure that the world needs, so that\u2019s kind of more how I think about what we\u2019re doing.",

The power you have over distribution is very clear \u2014 to publishers, to citizens and everyone else. How do you look at your role? Right now as we\u2019re doing this interview, there\u2019s a Congressional hearing going on. In that case, conservatives think that you don\u2019t give a voice to conservatives.\nYesterday, I wrote a story, which I think you read, about other publications think you give too.",

Then, there\u2019s keeping the community safe, which I think is really important. We\u2019re not gonna let people plan violence or attack each other or do bad things. Within this, those principles have real trade-offs and real tug on each other. In this case, we feel like our responsibility is to prevent hoaxes from going viral and being widely distributed.\nThe approach that we\u2019ve taken to false news is not to say, you can\u2019t say something wrong on the internet. I think that that would be too extreme. Everyone gets things wrong, and if we were taking down people\u2019s accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that. But at the same time, I think that we have a responsibility to, when you look at\u2026 if you look at the top hundred things that are going viral or getting distribution on Facebook within any given day, I do think we have a responsibility to make sure that those aren\u2019t hoaxes and blatant misinformation.\nThat\u2019s the approach that we\u2019ve taken. We look at the things that are getting the most distribution. If people have flag them as potential hoaxes, we send those to fact-checkers who are all well reputable and have followed standard principles for fact checking, and if those fact checkers say that it is provably false, then we will significantly reduce the distribution of that content, and if someone-",

It is clearly the responsibility of all of the players who were involved there. So, the government, civil society, the different folks who were involved, and I think that we have an important role, given the platform, that we play, so we need to make sure that we do what we need to. We\u2019ve significantly ramped up the investment in people who speak Burmese. It\u2019s often hard, from where we sit, to identify who are the figures who are promoting hate and what is going to... which is the content that is going to incite violence? So it\u2019s important that we build relationships with civil society and folks there who can help us identify that.\nI want make sure that our products are used for good. At the end of the day, other people blaming us or not is actually not the thing that matters to me. It\u2019s not that every single thing that happens on Facebook is gonna be good. This is humanity. People use tools for good and bad, but I think that we have a clear responsibility to make sure that the good is amplified and to do everything we can to mitigate the bad.\nLet me give you another example. When Live came up, one of the terrible use cases where people were using ... There were a small number of uses of this, but people were using it to ... show themselves [doing] self-harm, or there were even a few cases of suicide. We looked at this, we\u2019re like, \u201cThis is terrible. This is not what we want the product to be. This is terrible, and if this is happening and we can help prevent it, then we have a responsibility to.\u201d\nSo, what did we do? We took the time to build AI tools and to hire a team of 3,000 people to be able to respond to those live videos within 10 minutes. Most content on Facebook, we try to get to within hours or within a day, if it comes up, and obviously, if someone\u2019s gonna harm themselves, you don\u2019t have a day or hours. You have to get to that quickly. With all the millions of videos that are posted, we had to build this combination of an AI system that could flag content that our reviewers should look at, and then hire a specific team trained and dedicated to that, so that way they could review all the things very quickly and have a very low latency.\nIn the last six months, we\u2019ve been able to help first responders get to more than a thousand people who needed help quickly because of that effort.",

But on the other hand, if they have that information in Facebook and the developer has some relationship with us, then we also have a responsibility to protect people and keep people safe.\nAnd what happened here was a developer built a quiz app, and then they turned around and sold the data that people gave them to someone else. And that is clearly against all of the policies that we have. I mean, that\u2019s terrible, right? We don\u2019t sell data, we don\u2019t allow anyone to sell data.

I think that that\u2019s working, and the spotlight has been pointed on things that we have a responsibility to do better, and I accept that.\nWhile it may not be the most fun period of running the company, I think we take the responsibility really seriously and get that in the grand scheme of things, I don\u2019t think people are being unfair to us. I think people have been very positive and are focused on all the good that come with the technology for a long period of time. To have a period where people focus on some of the negative uses, to make sure that we fully understand that, I think is completely reasonable.\nIf there\u2019s going to be a period of two years where we frankly didn\u2019t handle a bunch of things as well as we should\u2019ve and need to get back on top of it, then I mean, you\u2019re not going to cry about that.

I think as a society, we spend the vast majority of our time talking about what the government should do in the political debates.\nI think we spend not enough time talking about how important community is. So you go around... I mean I saw, sit with ministers in places, and they talk about not just the religious role that they play as a religious organization, but as a community organization. One minister told me that he knew that when a factory closed down in town, he was gonna be seeing more couples for couples counseling a few weeks later because of the tension. All right. That\u2019s a real piece of social infrastructure that needs to exist.\nIf people aren\u2019t a part of those kind of organizations, then there\u2019s a core need that people have that is not being fulfilled.\nI sat down with kids in Chicago, a school where a lot of kids were in gangs. I mean, they told me the reason why people were in gangs is not because they wanted to be in a gang, they understood that it was dangerous, but because they needed a sense of community, and in a dangerous environment, they wanted to know that someone was looking after them.",

They thought that computers were gonna be valuable, and having that become ubiquitous. It was like an Apollo-like goal to me that always struck me as really nice.\nThen, I think his second act of going and being one of the world\u2019s best philanthropists has absolutely influenced me. Not only to try to follow in his footsteps and do something hopefully one day that will be as impactful as what he has done, but his lesson there that you have to start early to practice. Like anything that you want to get good at, you don\u2019t just show up and effectively and efficiently give money away. The notion that if I want be really good at this 10 or 15 years from now, then Priscilla and I really need to be starting to work on this now. He has had, he and Melinda, and Melinda has increasingly really been a role model for us as well, just have really deeply influenced the way that I think about both work and philanthropy.\nBut one of the things that I\u2019d say that I\u2019m really lucky is that a lot of the people who I look up to the most, I get to work with every day. I mean, I think Sheryl is amazing. A lot of what I know about business and building organizations and leadership come from working with her. A lot of the other folks who I get to work with every day, Chris Cox is just an amazing person. I always tell people that you should only hire people to be on your team if you would work for them. But in an alternate universe, I would be honored to work for any of these people. I think that that is, I don\u2019t know, that is greater gift than having some external mentors who I get to talk to once a quarter.",

They\u2019re always more native, they capture your human experience more. Immersively, you share more naturally what you\u2019re experiencing. I just think that VR and AR are going to be a really big deal.\nYou can just see this trajectory from early internet, when the technology and connections were slow, most of the internet was text. Text is great, but it can be sometimes hard to capture what\u2019s going on. Then, we all got phones with cameras on them and the internet got good enough to be primarily images. Now the networks are getting good enough that it\u2019s primarily video. At each step along the way, we\u2019re able to capture the human experience with greater fidelity and richness, and I think that that\u2019s great.\nNow, I do think that we\u2019re gonna move towards this world where eventually you\u2019ll be able to capture a whole experience that you\u2019re in and be able to send that to someone. I think that that\u2019s just gonna be an amazing technology for perspective taking and putting yourself in other people\u2019s shoes, for being able to feeling like you\u2019re really physically there with someone even when you\u2019re not.

You get all these people have to move to cities, and then the cities get to be way too expensive, and if you have a technology like VR where you can be present anywhere but live where you choose to, then I think that that can be really profound.\nThere\u2019re really only a few solutions to this. Historically, cities have grown to be bigger by building better physical infrastructure. There\u2019ll be some amount of that. I mean, I think things like hyperloops and things like that can extend the suburbs, could be quite interesting, but I have to believe that, we\u2019re here in 2018, it\u2019s much cheaper and easier to move bits around than it is atoms. It strikes me that something like VR or AR, or even video conferencing on the path to that, has to be a more likely part of the solution than just building a ton of physical infrastructure.",
