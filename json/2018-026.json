            "statement": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s story doesn\u2019t quite line up.\nFor months, the Facebook chief executive has described the 2016 election as a turning point both for him and for the company over which he holds enormous power.\nThe cavalcade of scandals that followed that November\u2014disputes over user data, fake news, and Russia\u2019s manipulation of the platform\u2014has led to a \u201cvery basic shift in how we view our responsibility,\u201d he said in an interview with The Atlantic on Friday. Now, Zuckerberg is transforming the company, opening it up to public scrutiny in unprecedented ways. \u201cA big theme\u201d going forward, he said, will be getting \u201cindependent expertise and assessment of the work that we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nYet Zuckerberg\u2014who is not only Facebook\u2019s CEO, but also the chairman of its board and its majority voting shareholder\u2014struggled to describe when his personal thinking about the company and its philosophy shifted. He could not articulate what changed his mind or drove him to adopt the new approach.\n\u201cWell, I certainly feel very bad, and I\u2019m sorry that we did not do a better job of finding the Russian interference during the 2016 election,\u201d Zuckerberg told me. \u201cI mean, that was a huge miss.\u201d\nAlmost unique among American companies, Facebook is the outgrowth of one man\u2019s sensibility. As that firm now changes its approach to the public, that man hasn\u2019t articulated why. In the days after I spoke to the famously private Zuckerberg, I have wondered whether it matters. Though he runs a company that constantly exhorts people to share how they feel, Zuckerberg himself seems uncomfortable with reflection. He has not ever, in my memory, appeared vulnerable in public. He has ignored the CEO playbook for a company that faces a crisis of public trust: He does not grovel, he does not evince embarrassment at the size of the lapse. He does not tell users: I feel your pain.\nShould we care? Does Zuckerberg\u2019s reticence only affect the public appearance of the firm\u2014is it just content-free pablum that we\u2019ve been raised to expect as American consumers?\u2014or does it reveal something of Zuckerberg\u2019s actual capacity for leadership? Americans don\u2019t necessarily need Zuckerberg to act like a normal CEO, personifying his company and hanging his head in shame. But they do need him to be commensurate to the institution he leads.\nOr perhaps actions speak louder than words\u2014in which case, there are plenty of actions to talk about. Today, Zuckerberg unveils the newest attempt at reform. Facebook will give a committee of senior academics independent access to its data, allowing researchers to study the social network\u2019s effect on democracy and elections. The work will be paid for by foundations spanning the ideological spectrum, and\u2014most importantly\u2014Facebook says it will not be able to veto studies before their publication.\nThe research program follows the news of a transparency program for political ads, announced last week. When Facebook users in the United States encounter an ad for a candidate or issue, they\u2019ll soon be able to see the identity of the advertiser, its cost, how it was targeted, and what other ads the advertiser ran.\nTaken together, the two measures constitute one of the company\u2019s more significant attempts at self-regulation in its 14-year history. The timing is not by happenstance. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg will testify before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees; on Wednesday, he will face the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\nHe has never appeared before Congress before. The New York Times reports that he has received a \u201ccrash course\u201d in warmth and charisma, training with a team of all-star lawyers and a former aide to President George W. Bush. He will need it: While neither he nor the politicians are particularly popular, many of the members of Congress he will face are former federal prosecutors who have spent hundreds of hours of their lives taking depositions. They love to grandstand; Zuckerberg loathes to speak in public at all.\nIt must be a surreal moment for the 33-year-old. Decisions he made two years ago are suddenly up for debate in the public sphere. Americans are grappling with his enormous personal power, and he appears to be taking some blame for the country\u2019s current political state. After he told me he felt \u201cvery bad\u201d about Russian interference on his platform, I asked: Was there an especially dark moment when he came to realize the role that Facebook played in the 2016 election?\nZuckerberg paused for eight long seconds. \u201cI need to think about that,\u201d he said eventually.\nWas there any one moment that stood out?\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s one in particular,\u201d he said.\nInstead, he told me, a broader evolution had taken place in the company \u201cacross a number of these issues, whether it\u2019s foreign interference or fake news or the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy issue recently.\u201d\n\u201cI think there\u2019s just been a very basic shift in how we view our responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to view our role as building tools for people and saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to put this power in your hands.\u2019 And we think people are basically good, and we think that that can have a net positive effect.\u201d\n\u201cNow I just think we understand\u2014both because of the ability for us to develop these things and because of the scale at which we operate\u2014that it\u2019s also our responsibility to make sure that all these tools are used well, not just to put them in people\u2019s hands,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\u201cYou know, you can\u2019t just give people a voice,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou need to also make sure that that voice is not used for foreign interference in elections or disseminating fake news.\u201d\nThe most important aspect of the new Facebook reforms\u2014at least according to Zuckerberg\u2014is that they are not just reactive. If Facebook is a castle, it must build its walls, maintain them, and make sure its more than 25,000 employees work to protect them\u2014all while constantly imagining new ways of coming under attack. But Facebook\u2019s adversaries, be they Russian hackers or a team of enterprising bigots, need only find one gap in the ramparts to wage a successful assault.\nWhat went wrong in 2016, Zuckerberg said, was in part a failure of imagination. His team caught Russia trying to interfere with campaigns\u2014for instance by phishing staff\u2014but it didn\u2019t understand the scale of the country\u2019s overall effort. \u201cWe were looking for different issues,\" he said. \u201cBut we were slow in identifying this new kind of attack, and we need to get ahead of that in the future.\u201d\nAnticipating different kinds of attacks is one reason why Facebook is now trying to show more information to Facebook users. Take the company\u2019s new political-ad transparency program.\n\u201cGenerally, you can come to Facebook, you can post what you want, you can run an ad,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cYou post something and then if it violates the community standards, someone flags it to us and then we review it. Increasingly we\u2019re building AI tools to do more of that proactively, but still a lot of it is reactive.\u201d\n\u201cGiven the importance of these elections, especially 2018\u2014with major elections in the United States, India, Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, Hungary coming up soon\u2014we just thought that that wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d he said.\nSo Facebook has taken two steps. First, it will require the individual owners of the largest Facebook pages to verify their names by providing the company with a copy of their government IDs. It will also make them respond to a letter in the mail.\n\u201cWe will physically mail a code to where you say you are, and you have to be able to access that code that we mail to you in order to be able to run an ad,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cI think that will be quite effective at preventing someone in Russia, for example, from lying and saying that they\u2019re in the United States and able to advertise in the election here.\u201d\nSecond, it will show Facebook users in the United States more information about each political ad. \u201cBasically, you can see some information about who\u2019s running it, and how much they paid for it, and who [they\u2019re] trying to target, and how many people have seen it,\u201d he said. Facebook users will also see the amount spent in dollars to run it.\nZuckerberg asserted this met an \u201ceven higher standard of transparency than what has traditionally existed on TV or print media for ads.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a way historically to go to some group and say, \u2018Hey, you know, you\u2019re trying to, you know, campaign for this candidate. Are you saying messages that are different to different people? Are they contradictory in different places?\u2019\u201d he said. (While this may make Facebook\u2019s transparency effort more extensive than that of TV, traditional media is compelled by law to disclose certain information about political ads. Outlets can be sanctioned if they do not comply.)\nBut this transparency effort relies on Facebook users to take initiative themselves. So the company is also opening a new academic research program, as it searches for outside scrutiny from experts.\nUnder that program, the company will give a committee of steering academics unprecedented access to Facebook\u2014sitting side by side with their data scientists, a spokesman told me\u2014and identify major research questions about the social network. The committee, organized by the Social Science Research Council, will then announce a call for papers and issue grants to fund the research.\nBoth the committee of academics and their research grants will be funded by a group of independent foundations, including the Hewlett Foundation, the Omidyar Network, and the Charles Koch Foundation. Unlike current studies about Facebook, which are conducted in conjunction with the company\u2019s product team, Facebook will not be able to review these academic papers before they are published.\nZuckerberg sounded relieved about that effort, in part because it will create a source of information about the company that does not itself come from the company. \u201cIn terms of just understanding the amount of problematic content on the platform, I think we need to be more transparent [so] that we can ground some of those debates in fact,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think a lot of the discourse that I see around fake news, for example, is grounded in anecdotes, right? Someone saw something and then they write about it. Which is fair because that\u2019s all the information that\u2019s out there today ... but I think we want to try to move beyond that,\u201d he said.\nAcademic researchers have begged for the ability to see Facebook data for years. After a massive study from MIT found that fake news traveled faster than accurate news on Twitter, the Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan told me: \u201cWe can study Twitter all day, but only about 12 percent of Americans are on it. It\u2019s important for journalists and academics, but it\u2019s not how most people get their news.\u201d\nFacebook is the 6 o\u2019clock news of the internet: Americans encounter news there not because they\u2019re political junkies who seek it out, but because it\u2019s presented to them amid statuses, photos, and everything else. More than two-thirds of Americans get their news from social media, and the vast majority of that group uses Facebook.\nSo transparency might not be enough. Facebook keeps encountering problems that are seemingly impossible to predict: It\u2019s just hard to protect a castle that\u2019s home to 2.1 billion people. And for every Facebook user in the United States, there are dozens in countries like the Philippines, Turkey, and Chile, where \u201cthe internet\u201d is synonymous with \u201cFacebook.\u201d\nMaybe these problems are inherent to any product or social network of Facebook\u2019s size. Is there a point at which Facebook is too big to be successfully managed at all?\n\u201cWell, I think what we need to do is be more transparent about what we\u2019re seeing and find ways to get independent and outside experts to be able to come in, and contribute ideas on how to address these issues, like things that might be problems,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd then hold us accountable for making sure we do it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re trying to create this independent election commission for research, because we think that getting this right for the elections starting in 2018, and after that, is just such an important thing,\u201d he told me.\nBut he is largely not ready to consider using democratic methods to govern Facebook itself\u2014like having users vote on major changes to the platform, for example. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken a bit about how I\u2019d like to create more community-based processes setting our content policies,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think we\u2019re still working through exactly how that would work, but that\u2019s certainly one example.\u201d\nCommunity is a term that Zuckerberg uses almost unfailingly when discussing the $450 billion company. But some of Facebook\u2019s other leaders\u2014and some of its critics\u2014have adopted other terms. Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, did not push back on Thursday when an NPR reporter called Facebook a \u201cpublisher.\u201d In New York last year, the journalist Max Read compared Facebook to the EU, the Catholic Church, and a \u201cfaceless Elder God.\u201d\nI asked Zuckerberg outright: What is Facebook?\n\u201cI mean, I think it\u2019s a lot of things,\u201d he said, then he paused. \u201cBut you know, overall I think about it as a community.\u201d While that broad description may be an accurate characterization of the platform, it\u2019s also one that helps Facebook avoid seeming to work in businesses that are subject to government regulation.\n\u201cI know that a lot of the biggest issues that we face are fundamentally trade-offs between different people\u2019s interests in the community: What speech is allowed? How do you manage the balance between people wanting to share but people also wanting to see what other people are doing? All of these really complex interactions are what makes, I think, the community work well,\u201d he said.\nLast week, on a press call with dozens of reporters, he told my colleague Alexis Madrigal that managing conflicts between Facebook-as-a-community and Facebook-as-a-company was \u201cquite easy.\u201d\nWhether that assessment is glib, na\u00efve, or something else entirely, it hardly matters, because no one else can do Zuckerberg\u2019s job. He has near total control of the levers of that community. Even though Facebook went public in 2012, he retained a majority of its voting shares. This means that he can decide at will to sacrifice its short-term profits: In a statement in November, Zuckerberg warned that \u201cwe\u2019re investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability.\u201d\nBut his sole control over Facebook means he also rules unequivocally. If there is one trusted confidant he turns to for advice, he didn\u2019t say. Instead, he said, he looks for guidance everywhere. \u201cI read a lot. I talk to a lot of people. We have a great team here. I think the real challenge is: How do we get so many of the smart people who are out there engaged in some way?\u201d\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re building is unprecedented, and we\u2019re going to need new models to be able to get input and for the public to be able to trust that what we\u2019re doing is good,\u201d he said.\nAnd there is a gap here that clearly nags him, between what he knows and what the public can know. Experts \u201cwho people count on to assess how companies are doing can\u2019t actually have access to the data to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have outside academics come in and look at people\u2019s data, right? I mean there are real issues to that\u2014that prevent, I think, both us being able to get [their] opinion and benefit from [them], and from us being able to have a good discourse as a society.\u201d\nFirst, though, Zuckerberg must win back the support of that society. The company is currently embroiled in the worst crisis of trust in its 14-year history. Facebook stock has fallen 14 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal was announced. Last week, the financial columnist Felix Salmon called for Zuckerberg\u2019s resignation in Wired.\nZuckerberg\u2019s fellow technology executives have been unusually unsparing in their criticism. In March, Elon Musk had Tesla and SpaceX delete their Facebook pages. And when Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, was asked what he would do if he were in Zuckerberg\u2019s situation, he said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\u201d\nI asked Zuckerberg: Have you considered resigning at all?\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2014I am\u2014I do work on philanthropy too, separately. But, these issues are very important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also worked on a lot of hard problems over the last 14 years building Facebook. I mean, it started in a dorm room and now it\u2019s this unprecedented community in scale and I\u2019m very confident that we're gonna be able to work through these issues.\u201d",
