The issues we will consider range from data privacy and security to consumer protection and the Federal Trade Commission enforcement touching on jurisdictions of these two committees.\nWe have 44 members between our two committees. That may not seem like a large group by Facebook standards ...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... but it is significant here for a hearing in the United States Senate. We will do our best to keep things moving efficiently given our circumstances. We will begin with opening statements from the chairmen and ranking members of each committee, starting with Chairman Thune, and then proceed to Mr. Zuckerberg's opening statement.\nWe will then move onto questioning. Each member will have five minutes to question witnesses.\nI'd like to remind the members of both committees that time limits will be and must be strictly enforced given the numbers that we have here today. If you're over your time, Chairman Thune and I will make sure to let you know. There will not be a second round as well. Of course there will be the usual follow-up written questions for the record. Questioning will alternate between majority and minority and between committees. We will proceed in order based on respective committee seniority.\nWe will anticipate a couple short breaks later in the afternoon.\nAnd so it's my pleasure to recognize the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Chairman Thune, for his opening statement.",

It's even more extraordinary to have a single CEO testify before nearly half of the United States Senate.\nBut then, Facebook is pretty extraordinary. More than 2 billion people use Facebook every month. 1.4 billion people use it every day; more than the population of any country on Earth except China, and more than four times the population of the United States. It's also more than 1,500 times the population of my home state of South Dakota.\nPlus, roughly 45 percent of American adults report getting at least some of their news from Facebook.\nIn many respects, Facebook's incredible reach is why we're here today. We're here because of what you, Mr. Zuckerberg, have described as a breach of trust.\nA quiz app used by approximately 300,000 people led to information about 87 million Facebook users being obtained by the company Cambridge Analytica.\nThere are plenty of questions about the behavior of Cambridge Analytica and we expect to hold a future hearing on Cambridge and similar firms. But as you've said, this is not likely to be an isolated incident; a fact demonstrated by Facebook's suspension of another firm just this past weekend.",

            "statement": "You've promised that when Facebook discovers other apps that had access to large amounts of user data, you will ban them and tell those affected. And that's appropriate, but it's unlikely to be enough for the 2 billion Facebook users.\nOne reason that so many people are worried about this incident is what it says about how Facebook works. The idea that for every person who decided to try an app, information about nearly 300 other people was scraped from your service is, to put it mildly, disturbing.\nAnd the fact that those 87 million people may have technically consented to making their data available doesn't make those people feel any better.\nThe recent revelation that malicious actors were able to utilize Facebook's default privacy settings to match email addresses and phone numbers found on the so-called Dark Web to public Facebook profiles potentially affecting all Facebook users only adds fuel to the fire.\nWhat binds these two incidents is that they don't appear to be caused by the kind of negligence that allows typical data breaches to happen. Instead they both appear to be the result of people exploiting the very tools that you created to manipulate users' information.\nI know Facebook has taken several steps, and intends to take more, to address these issues. Nevertheless, some have warned that the actions Facebook is taking to ensure that third parties do not obtain data from unsuspecting users, while necessary, will actually serve to enhance Facebook's own ability to market such data exclusively.\nMost of us understand that whether you are using Facebook or Google or some other online services, we are trading certain information about ourselves for free or low-cost services. But for this model to persist, both sides of the bargain need to know the stakes that are involved. Right now I am not convinced that Facebook's users have the information that they need to make meaningful choices.\nIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies' efforts to regulate themselves, but this may be changing.\nJust last month, in overwhelming bipartisan fashion, Congress voted to make it easier for prosecutors and victims to go after websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. This should be a wake-up call for the tech community.\nWe want to hear more, without delay, about what Facebook and other companies plan to do to take greater responsibility for what happens on their platforms.\nHow will you protect users' data? How will you inform users about the changes that you are making? And how do you intend to proactively stop harmful conduct instead of being forced to respond to it months or years later?\nMr. Zuckerberg, in many ways you and the company that you created, the story that you've created represents the American Dream. Many are incredibly inspired by what you've done.\nAt the same time, you have an obligation, and it's up to you, to ensure that that dream does not becalm a privacy nightmare for the scores of people who use Facebook.\nThis hearing is an opportunity to speak to those who believe in Facebook and those who are deeply skeptical about it. We are listening, America is listening and quite possibly the world is listening, too.",

You have a real opportunity this afternoon to lead the industry and demonstrate a meaningful commitment to protecting individual privacy.\nWe have learned over the past few months, and we've learned a great deal that's alarming. We've seen how foreign actors are abusing social media platforms like Facebook to interfere in elections and take millions of Americans' personal information without their knowledge in order to manipulate public opinion and target individual voters.\nSpecifically, on February the 16th, Special Counsel Mueller issued an indictment against the Russia-based Internet Research Agency and 13 of its employees for interfering (sic) operations targeting the United States.\nThrough this 37-page indictment, we learned that the IRA ran a coordinated campaign through 470 Facebook accounts and pages. The campaign included ads and false information to create discord and harm Secretary Clinton's campaign, and the content was seen by an estimated 157 million Americans.\nA month later, on March 17th, news broke that Cambridge Analytica exploited the personal information of approximately 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge or permission. And, last week, we learned that number was even higher: 87 million Facebook users who had their private information taken without their consent.\nSpecifically, using a personality quiz he created, Professor Kogan collected the personal information of 300,000 Facebook users, and then collected data on millions of their friends.\nIt appears the information collected included everything these individuals had on their Facebook pages and, according to some reports, even included private direct messages between users.\nProfessor Kogan is said to have taken data from over 70 million Americans. It has also been reported that he sold this data to Cambridge Analytica for $800,000 dollars. Cambridge Analytica then took this data and created a psychological warfare tool to influence United States elections.\nIn fact, the CEO, Alexander Nix, declared that Cambridge Analytica ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and its data informed all the strategy for the Trump campaign.\nThe reporting has also speculated that Cambridge Analytica worked with the Internet Research Agency to help Russia identify which American voters to target, which its \u2014 with its propaganda.\nI'm concerned that press reports indicate Facebook learned about this breach in 2015, but appears not to have taken significant steps to address it until this year.\nSo this hearing is important, and I appreciate the conversation we had yesterday. And I believe that Facebook, through your presence here today and the words you're about to tell us, will indicate how strongly your industry will regulate and/or reform the platforms that they control.",

            "statement": "Thank you, Senator Feinstein.\nThe history and growth of Facebook mirrors that of many of our technological giants. Founded by Mr. Zuckerberg in 2004, Facebook has exploded over the past 14 years. Facebook currently has over 2 billion monthly active users across the world, over 25,000 employees, and offices in 13 U.S. cities and various other countries.\nLike their expanding user base, the data collected on Facebook users has also skyrocketed. They have moved on from schools, likes and relationship statuses. Today, Facebook has access of data points, ranging from ads that you've clicked on, events you've attended and your location, based upon your mobile device.\nIt is no secret that Facebook makes money off this data through advertising revenue, although many seem confused by or altogether unaware of this fact. Facebook generates \u2014 generated $40 billion in revenue in 2017, with about 98 percent coming from advertising across Facebook and Instagram.\nSignificant data collection is also occurring at Google, Twitter, Apple, and Amazon. And even \u2014 an ever-expanding portfolio of products and services offered by these companies grant endless opportunities to collect increasing amounts of information on their customers.\nAs we get more free or extremely low-cost services, the trade-off for the American consumer is to provide more personal data. The potential for further growth and innovation based on collection of data is unlimitedless. However, the potential for abuse is also significant.\nWhile the contours of the Cambridge Analytica situation are still coming to light, there was clearly a breach of consumer trust and a likely improper transfer of data. The Judiciary Committee will hold a separate hearing exploring Cambridge and other data privacy issues.\nMore importantly, though, these events have ignited a larger discussion on consumers' expectations and the future of data privacy in our society. It has exposed that consumers may not fully understand or appreciate the extent to which their data is collected, protected, transferred, used and misused.\nData has been used in advertising and political campaigns for decades. The amount and type of data obtained, however, has seen a very dramatic change. Campaigns including Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump all use these increasing amounts of data to focus on microtargeting and personalization over numerous social media platforms, and especially Facebook.\nIn fact, Presidents \u2014 Obama's campaign developed an app utilizing the same Facebook feature as Cambridge Analytica to capture the information of not just the app's users, but millions of their friends.",

But their use over the past years, across the political spectrum, and their increased significance cannot be ignored. Our policy towards data privacy and security must keep pace with these changes.\nData privacy should be tethered to consumer needs and expectations. Now, at a minimum, consumers must have the transparency necessary to make an informed decision about whether to share their data and how it can be used.\nConsumers ought to have clearer information, not opaque policies and complex click-through consent pages. The tech industry has an obligation to respond to widespread and growing concerns over data privacy and security and to restore the public's trust.\nThe status quo no longer works. Moreover, Congress must determine if and how we need to strengthen privacy standards to ensure transparency and understanding for the billions of consumers who utilize these products.\nSenator Nelson.",

If you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy anymore. That's what we're facing.\nWe're talking about personally identifiable information that, if not kept by the social media \u2014 media companies from theft, a value that we have in America, being our personal privacy \u2014 we won't have it anymore. It's the advent of technology.\nAnd, of course, all of us are part of it. From the moment that we wake up in the morning, until we go to bed, we're on those handheld tablets. And online companies like Facebook are tracking our activities and collecting information.\nFacebook has a responsibility to protect this personal information. We had a good discussion yesterday. We went over all of this. You told me that the company had failed to do so.\nIt's not the first time that Facebook has mishandled its users' information. The FTC found that Facebook's privacy policies had deceived users in the past. And, in the present case, we recognize that Cambridge Analytica and an app developer lied to consumers and lied to you, lied to Facebook.\nBut did Facebook watch over the operations? We want to know that. And why didn't Facebook notify 87 million users that their personally identifiable information had been taken, and it was being also used \u2014 why were they not informed \u2014 for unauthorized political purposes?",

I got that sense in conversing with you. You want to do the right thing. You want to enact reforms. We want to know if it's going to be enough. And I hope that will be the in the answers today.\nNow, since we still don't know what Cambridge Analytica has done with this data, you heard Chairman Thune say, as we have discussed, we want to haul Cambridge Analytica in to answer these questions at a separate hearing.\nI want to thank Chairman Thune for working with all of us on scheduling a hearing. There's obviously a great deal of interest in this subject. I hope we can get to the bottom of this. And, if Facebook and other online companies will not or cannot fix the privacy invasions, then we are going to have to \u2014 we, the Congress.\nHow can American consumers trust folks like your company to be caretakers of their most personal and identifiable information?

And you will rightfully have some hard questions for me to answer. Before I talk about the steps we're taking to address them, I want to talk about how we got here.\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most of our existence, we focused on all of the good that connecting people can do. And, as Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love, for making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses.\nJust recently, we've seen the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement and the March for our Lives organized, at least in part, on Facebook. After Hurricane Harvey, people came together to raise more than $20 million for relief. And more than 70 million businesses \u2014 small business use Facebook to create jobs and grow.\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm, as well. And that goes for fake news, for foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.",

            "statement": "We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.\nSo, now, we have to go through our \u2014 all of our relationship with people and make sure that we're taking a broad enough view of our responsibility.\nIt's not enough to just connect people. We have to make sure that those connections are positive. It's not enough to just give people a voice. We need to make sure that people aren't using it to harm other people or to spread misinformation. And it's not enough to just give people control over their information. We need to make sure that the developers they share it with protect their information, too.\nAcross the board, we have a responsibility to not just build tools, but to make sure that they're used for good. It will take some time to work through all the changes we need to make across the company, but I'm committed to getting this right. This includes the basic responsibility of protecting people's information, which we failed to do with Cambridge Analytica.\nSo here are a few things that we are doing to address this and to prevent it from happening again.\nFirst, we're getting to the bottom of exactly what Cambridge Analytica did, and telling everyone affected. What we know now is that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed some information about millions of Facebook members by buying it from an app developer.\nThat information \u2014 this was information that people generally share publicly on their Facebook pages, like names and their profile picture and the pages they follow.\nWhen we first contacted Cambridge Analytica, they told us that they had deleted the data. About a month ago, we heard new reports that suggested that wasn't true. And, now, we're working with governments in the U.S., the U.K. and around the world to do a full audit of what they've done and to make sure they get rid of any data they may still have.\nSecond, to make sure no other app developers out there are misusing data, we're now investigating every single app that had access to a large amount of information in the past. And, if we find that someone improperly used data, we're going to ban them from Facebook and tell everyone affected.\nThird, to prevent this from ever happening again, going forward, we're making sure that developers can't access as much information now. The good news here is that we already made big changes to our platform in 2014 that would have prevented this specific situation with Cambridge Analytica from occurring again today.\nBut there's more to do, and you can find more details on the steps we're taking in my written statement.\nMy top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community and bringing the world closer together. Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that, as long as I am running Facebook.\nI started Facebook when I was in college. We've come a long way since then. We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world. And, every day, people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most.\nI believe deeply in what we are doing. And I know that, when we address these challenges we'll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world.\nI realize the issues we're talking about today aren't just issues for Facebook and our community. They're issues and challenges for all of us as Americans.\nThank you for having me here today, and I'm ready to take your questions.",

So \u2014 actually, maybe, if \u2014 if you're okay with it, I'll go in the other order.\nSo, from the beginning of the company in 2004 \u2014 I started in my dorm room; it was me and my roommate. We didn't have A.I. technology that could look at the content that people were sharing. So \u2014 so we basically had to enforce our content policies reactively.\nPeople could share what they wanted, and then, if someone in the community found it to be offensive or against our policies, they'd flag it for us, and we'd look at it reactively. Now, increasingly, we're developing A.I. tools that can identify certain classes of bad activity proactively and flag it for our team at Facebook.\nBy the end of this year, by the way, we're going to have more than 20,000 people working on security and content review, working across all these things. So, when content gets flagged to us, we have those \u2014 those people look at it. And, if it violates our policies, then we take it down.\nSome problems lend themselves more easily to A.I. solutions than others. So hate speech is one of the hardest, because determining if something is hate speech is very linguistically nuanced, right?\nIt's \u2014 you need to understand, you know, what is a slur and what \u2014 whether something is hateful not just in English, but the majority of people on Facebook use it in languages that are different across the world.\nContrast that, for example, with an area like finding terrorist propaganda, which we've actually been very successful at deploying A.I. tools on already.\nToday, as we sit here, 99 percent of the ISIS and Al Qaida content that we take down on Facebook, our A.I. systems flag before any human sees it. So that's a success in terms of rolling out A.I. tools that can proactively police and enforce safety across the community.\nHate speech \u2014 I am optimistic that, over a 5 to 10-year period, we will have A.I. tools that can get into some of the nuances \u2014 the linguistic nuances of different types of content to be more accurate in flagging things for our systems.\nBut, today, we're just not there on that. So a lot of this is still reactive. People flag it to us. We have people look at it. We have policies to try to make it as not subjective as possible.

And we talked a little bit earlier around the complexity of laying out these long privacy policies. It's hard to say that people fully understand something when it's only written out in a long legal document. This needs \u2014 the stuff needs to be implemented in a way where people can actually understand it, where consumers can \u2014 can understand it, but that can also capture all the nuances of how these services work in a way that doesn't \u2014 that's not overly restrictive on \u2014 on providing the services. That's one.\nThe second is around giving people complete control. This is the most important principle for Facebook: Every piece of content that you share on Facebook, you own and you have complete control over who sees it and \u2014 and how you share it, and you can remove it at any time.\nThat's why every day, about 100 billion times a day, people come to one of our services and either post a photo or send a message to someone, because they know that they have that control and that who they say it's going to go to is going to be who sees the content.\nAnd I think that that control is something that's important that I think should apply to \u2014 to every service.\nAnd the third point is \u2014 is just around enabling innovation. Because some of the abuse cases that \u2014 that are very sensitive, like face recognition, for example \u2014 and I feel there's a balance that's extremely important to strike here, where you obtain special consent for sensitive features like face recognition, but don't \u2014 but we still need to make it so that American companies can innovate in those areas, or else we're going to fall behind Chinese competitors and others around the world who have different regimes for \u2014 for different new features like that.",

And I believe we need to have laws and rules that are sophisticated as the \u2014 the brilliant products that you've developed here. And we just haven't done that yet.\nAnd one of the areas that I've focused on is the election. And I appreciate the support that you and Facebook, and now Twitter, actually, have given to the Honest Ads Act bill that you mentioned, that I'm leading with Senator McCain and Senator Warner.\nAnd I just want to be clear, as we work to pass this law so that we have the same rules in place to disclose political ads and issue ads as we do for TV and radio, as well as disclaimers, that you're going to take early action, as soon as June I heard, before this election so that people can view these ads, including issue ads.

So that actually brings advertising online \u2014 on Facebook to an even higher standard than what you would have on TV or print media, because there's nowhere where you can see all of the TV ads that someone is running, for example. Whereas you will be able to see now on Facebook whether this campaign or third party is saying different messages to different types of people, and I think that that's a really important element of transparency.\nBut the other really important piece is around verifying every single advertiser who's going to be running political or issue ads.",

You have cartoonlike stickers, and other features designed to appeal to little kids \u2014 first-graders, kindergartners.\nOn January 30th, the Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood and lots of other child development organizations warned Facebook. They pointed to a wealth of research demonstrating the excessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to kids, and argued that young children simply are not ready to handle social media accounts at age 6. In addition, their concerns about data that is being gathered about these kids.\nNow, there are certain limits of the law, we know. There's a Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

The background on Messenger Kids is, we heard feedback from thousands of parents that they want to be able to stay in touch with their kids and call them, use apps like FaceTime when they're working late or not around and want to communicate with their kids, but they want to have complete control over that. So I think we can all agree that if you \u2014 when your kid is 6 or 7, even if they have access to a phone, you want to control everyone who they can contact. And there was an app out there that did that. So we build this service to do that.\nThe app collects a minimum amount of information that is necessary to operate the service. So, for example, the messages that people send is something that we collect in order to operate the service, but in general, that data is not going to be shared with third parties, it is not connected to the broader Facebook ...",

So that's all the photos that you share, the posts that you make, what you think of as the Facebook service, right? That's \u2014 everyone has control every single time that they go to share that. They can delete that data any time they want; full control, the majority of the data.\nThe second category is around specific data that we collect in order to make the advertising experiences better, and more relevant, and work for businesses. And those often revolve around measuring, okay, if you \u2014 if we showed you an ad, then you click through and you go somewhere else, we can measure that you actually \u2014 that the \u2014 that the ad worked. That helps make the experience more relevant and better for \u2014 for people, who are getting more relevant ads, and better for the businesses because they perform better.\nYou also have control completely of that second type of data.

Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for joining us today.\nI think the whole reason we're having this hearing is because of a tension between two basic principles you have laid out. First you've said about the data that users post on Facebook. You control and own the data that you put on Facebook. You said some very positive, optimistic things about privacy and data ownership. But it's also the reality that Facebook is a for-profit entity that generated $40 billion in ad revenue last year by targeting ads.\nIn fact, Facebook claims that advertising makes it easy to find the right people, capture their attention and get results and you recognize that an ad-supported service is, as you said earlier today, best aligned with your mission and values.\nBut the reality is, there's a lot of examples where ad targeting has led to results that I think we would all disagree with or dislike or would concern us. You've already admitted that Facebook's own ad tools allow Russians to target users, voters based on racist or anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant views, and that that may have played a significant role in election here in United States.\nJust today, Time magazine posted a story saying that wildlife traffickers are continuing to use Facebook tools to advertise illegal sales of protected animal parts, and I am left questioning whether your ad-targeting schools would allow other concerning practices like diet pill manufacturers targeting teenagers who are struggling with their weight, or allowing a liquor distributor to target alcoholics or a gambling organization to target those with gambling problems.\nI'll give you one concrete example I'm sure you are familiar with: ProPublica back in 2016 highlighted that Facebook lets advertisers exclude users by race in real estate advertising. There was a way that you could say that this particular ad, I only want to be seen by white folks, not by people of color, and that clearly violates fair-housing laws and our basic sense of fairness in the United States. And you promptly announced that that was a bad idea, you were going to change the tools, and that you would build a new system to spot and reject discriminatory ads that violate our commitment to fair housing.",

And yet, there doesn't seem to have been as much follow up as would be called for.\nAt the end of the day, policies aren't worth the paper they're written on if Facebook doesn't enforce them.\nAnd I'll close with a question that's really rooted in an experience I had today, as an avid Facebook user. I woke up this morning and was notified by a whole group of friends across the country, asking if I had a new family, or if there was a fake Facebook post of Chris Coons?\nI went to the one they suggested. It had a different middle initial than mine. And there's my picture with Senator Dan Sullivan's family; same schools I went to, but a whole lot of Russian friends.

Hate groups thrive in some areas of Facebook, even though your policies prohibit hate speech, and you've taken strong steps against extremism and terrorists.\nBut is a Delawarean who's not in the Senate going to get the same sort of quick response? I've already gotten input from other friends who say they've had trouble getting a positive response when they've brought to Facebook's attention a page that's, frankly, clearly violating your basic principals.\nMy core question is isn't it Facebook's job to better protect its users? And why do you shift the burden to users to flag inappropriate content and make sure it's taken down?",

I remain interested in Facebook's assertion that it rejects any suggestion of violating that consent order. Part two of that consent order requires that Facebook, quote, \u201cclearly and prominently\u201d display notice and obtain users' affirmative consent before sharing their information with, quote, \u201cany third party.?\nMy question is how does the case of approximately 87 million Facebook friends having their data shared with a third party due to the consent of only 300,000 consenting users not violate that agreement?",

People had settings to that effect. We explained and \u2014 and they consented to \u2014 to it working that way. And the \u2014 the system basically worked as it was designed.\nThe issue is that we designed the system in a way that wasn't good. And now we \u2014 starting in 2014, have changed the design of the system to that that way it just massively restricts the amount of \u2014 of data access that a developer could get.\n(CROSSTALK)",

I mean, it's \u2014 in 2007, we \u2014 we announced the Facebook developer platform, and the idea was that you wanted to make more experiences social, right?\nSo, for example, if you \u2014 like, you might want to have a calendar that can have your friends' birthdays on it, or you might want your address book to have your friends' pictures in it, or you might want a map that can show your friends' addresses on it. In order to do that, we needed to build a tool that allowed people to sign in to an app and bring some of their information, and some of their friends' information, to those apps. We made it very clear that this is how it worked, and \u2014 and when people signed up for Facebook, they signed up for that as well.\nNow, a lot of good use cases came from that. I mean, there were games that were built. There were integrations with companies that, I think, we're familiar with, like Netflix and Spotify. But over time, what became clear was that that also enabled some abuse. And that's why in 2014, we took the step of changing the platform. So now, when people sign in to an app, you do not bring some of your friends' information with you. You're only bringing your own information and you're able to connect with friends who have also authorized that app directly.",

As you know, much of my life has been focused on low-income communities, poor communities, working-class communities, and trying to make sure they have a fair shake. This country has a very bad history of discriminatory practices towards low-income Americans and Americans of color, from the redlining FHA practices, even to more recently really just discriminatory practices in the mortgage business. I've always seen technology as a promise to democratize our nation, expand access, expand opportunities.\nBut unfortunately, we've also seen how platforms, technology platforms like Facebook, can actually be used to double down on discrimination and \u2014 and give people more sophisticated tools with which to discriminate.\nNow in \u2014 in 19 \u2014 in 2000 \u2014 in 2016, ProPublica revealed that advertisers could use ethnic affinity, a users race to market categories to potentially discriminate overall against Facebook users in the areas of housing, employment and credit, echoing a dark history in this country, and \u2014 and also in violation of federal law.\nIn 2016, Facebook committed to fixing this, that the advertisers who have access to this data, to fixing it. But unfortunately a year later as \u2014 as \u2014 as ProPublica's article showed, they found that the system Facebook built was still allowing housing ads without applying \u2014 to go forward without applying these new restrictions that were put on.\nFacebook then opted in a system that's very similar to what we've been talking about with Cambridge Analytica, that they could self certify that they were not engaging in these practices and complying with federal law, using this self certification away and \u2014 and \u2014 to \u2014 to overcome and to comply with rather Facebook's anti-discrimination policy.\nUnfortunately, in a recent lawsuit, as of February 2018, alleges that discriminatory ads were still being created on Facebook, still disproportionately impacting low-income communities and communities of color.\nGiven the fact that you allow Cambridge Analytica to self certify in a way that I think \u2014 at least I think you've expressed regret over, is self certification the best and strongest way to safeguard \u2014 guard against the misuse of your platform and protect the data of users, not let it be manipulated in such a discriminatory fashion.",

You know, you've talked about your very humble beginnings in starting Facebook in \u2014 in your dorm room, which I appreciated that story but certainly Facebook has changed an awful lot over a relatively short period of time. When Facebook launched it's timeline feature, consumers saw their friends post chronologically, was the process.\nBut Facebook has since then changed to a timeline driven by some very sophisticated algorithms. And I think it has left many people, as a result of that, asking, you know, why \u2014 why am I seeing this \u2014 this feed and why am I seeing this right now. And now, in light of the Cambridge Analytica issue, Facebook users are asking, I think, some new questions right now.\nCan I believe what I'm seeing and who has access to this information about me? So I think it's safe to say, very simply, that Facebook is losing the trust of an awful lot of Americans as a result of this incident. And \u2014 and I think an example of this is something that I've been hearing a lot from folks that have been coming up to me and talking about really, kind of the experience they've had, where they're having a conversation with friends.\nNot on the phone, just talking. And then they see ads popping up fairly quickly on their Facebook. So I've heard constituents fear that Facebook is mining audio from their mobile devices for the purpose of ad targeting. Which I think speaks to this lack of trust that we're seeing here, but \u2014 and I understand there's some technical issues and logistical issues for that to happen.\nBut for the record, I think it's clear \u2014 see, I hear it all the time, including from my own staff.

But further down, you listed out the facts since the new platform was released in 2007; sort of, a timeline. You start with 2007, then you jump to the Cambridge Analytica issue.\nI actually think that we need to fully examine what Cambridge Analytica did. They either broke a kind of code of conduct. If they broke any other rules or agreements with you all, I hope that they suffer the consequences.",

            "speaker": "TILLIS",
            "statement": "But I think that timeline needs to be updated. And it really needs to go back \u2014 I've read a series of three articles that were published in the MIT Technology Review back in 2012, and it talks about how proud the Obama campaign was of exploiting data on Facebook in the 2012 campaign.\nIn fact, somebody asked you earlier if it made you mad about what Cambridge Analytica did, and you rightfully answered yes, but I think you should probably be equally mad when a former campaign director of the Obama campaign proudly tweeted \u201cFacebook was surprised we were able to suck out the social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.\u201d\nSo you clearly had some people in your employ that apparently knew it, at least that's what this person said on Twitter, and thank goodness for Wayback and some of the other history-grabber machines. I'm sure we can get this tweet back and get it in the right context. I think when you do your research, it's important to get the whole view. I've worked in data-analytics practice for a good part of my career, and for anybody to pretend that Cambridge Analytica was the first person to exploit data, clearly doesn't work or hasn't worked in the data-analytics field.\nSo when you go back and do your research on Cambridge Analytica, I would personally appreciate it if you'd start back from the first known high-profile national campaign that exploited Facebook data.\nIn fact, they published an app that said it would grab information about my friends, their birth dates, locations and likes. So presumably if I downloaded that app that was published by the Obama campaign, I've got 4,900 friends on my Facebook page. I delete the haters and save room for family members and true friends on my personal page, as I'm sure everybody does. And that means if I clicked yes on that app, I would have approved the access of birth dates, locations, and likes of some 4,900 people without their consent. So as you do the chronology, I think it'd be very helpful so that we can take away the partisan rhetoric that's going on like this is a Republican-only issue. It's a \u2014 it's a broad based issue that needs to be fixed. And bad actors at either end of the political spectrum need to be held accountable, and I \u2014 and I trust that you all are going to work on that.\nI think the one thing that I \u2014 so for that, I just want to get to the facts, and there's no way you could answer any of the questions, I'm not going to burden you with that. But I think getting that chronology would be very helpful.\nThe one thing I would encourage people to do is go to Facebook. I'm \u2014 I'm a proud member of Facebook, just got a post from my sister on this being National Sibling Day, so I've connected with four or five of my staff while I was giving you my undivided \u2014 or family undivided attention. But go to the privacy tab. If you don't want to share something, don't share it. This is a free service. Go on there and say I don't want to allow third party search engines to get in my Facebook page. Go on there and say only my friends can look at it. Go on there and understand what you're signing up for. It's a free app.\nNow you need to do more. And I think it would be helpful. I didn't read your disclaimer page or the terms of use, because that is anywhere in there that I could get an attorney and negotiate the terms. So it was a terms of use. I went on there then I used the privacy settings to be as safe as I could be with a presence on Facebook.\nLast thing, we talk about all these proposed legislation, good ideas, but I have one question for you: When you were developing this app in your dorm, how many people did you have in your regulatory affairs division? Exactly. So if government takes a handy \u2014 heavy-handed approach to fix this problem, then we know very well that the next Facebook, the next thing that you're going to wake up and worry about how you continue to be relevant as the behemoth that you are today, is probably not going to happen.",

And those questions have included whether Facebook can track user's browsing activity even after the user has logged off of Facebook, whether Facebook can track your activity across devices even when you are not logged into Facebook. Who is Facebook's biggest competition? Whether Facebook may store up to 96 categories of user's information. Whether you knew whether Kogan's terms of service and whether you knew if that Kogan could sell or transfer data.\nAnd then another case in point, specifically as it relates to Cambridge Analytica is, and a concern of mine, is that you \u2014 meaning Facebook \u2014 and I'm going to assume you personally as a CEO \u2014 became aware of December 2015 that Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica misappropriated data from 87 million Facebook users.

You've said in your testimony that Facebook's mission is to bring the world closer together, and you've said that you will never prioritize advertisers over that mission.

There are two sets of steps that we're taking to make sure that this doesn't happen again.\nThe most important is restricting the amount of accessed information that developers will have going forward. The good news here is that back in 2014, we actually had already made a large change to restrict access on the platform that would have prevented this issue with Cambridge Analytica from happening again today. Clearly we did not do that soon enough.\nIf we'd done it a couple of years earlier, then we probably wouldn't be sitting here today.

I think its important you're here, because social media \u2014 your social media platform happens to be the ubiquitous social media platform, and there's not a senator that you heard from today that isn't on Facebook, that doesn't communicate with our constituents through Facebook. In a sense, we have to be on it, and so I think its especially important that you're here, not just for Facebook, but really for our country and beyond.\nThe threshold question that \u2014 that continues to emerge here today is what are the reasonable expectations of privacy that users ought to have? And I'll tell you my neighbors are unsatisfied by an answer to that question that involves, you know, \u201ctake a look at the user agreement.\u201d And I \u2014 I think there's been a fair amount of discussion here about whether or not people actually read that user agreement. I would encourage you to, you know, survey that, get all the information you can with respect to that, and make sure that \u2014 make sure that user agreement is easy to understand and streamlined and so forth.\nMr. Zuckerberg, earlier in today's hearing you drew a distinction that I thought was interesting. It caught my attention. It was a distinction between the consumer expectation of privacy depending upon whether they were on an ISP or \u201cthe pipes of the Internet,\u201d as you characterized it, or on an Edge platform, like Facebook.\nI find this distinction somewhat unsatisfying, because most folks who use the Internet just think of it as one place, if you will. They think of it as \u201cthe Internet,\u201d as opposed to various places requiring different degrees of privacy.\nCould you \u2014 could you speak to this issue and indicate whether you'd support a comprehensive privacy policy that applies in the same manner to all entities across the entire net \u2014 Internet ecosystem.",

People kind of want to store that in a central place, so that way they can go access it from \u2014 from a lot of different devices.\nIn order to do that, we need to have an understanding of what that content is.

So \u2014 but overall I think it's a very informative hearing, Mr. Chairman, and \u2014 and \u2014 so I'm \u2014 I'm ready to wrap it up.",

            "statement": "Yes, I probably wouldn't make this comment, but you're response to him in regard to political speech, I won't identify the CEO I had a conversation with yesterday, but one of our platforms \u2014 and he admitted to being more or left than right, or I mean being left I guess is what he admitted and I don't want to \u2014 I'm not asking you what you are, but it \u2014 but just so you understand that \u2014 that probably as liberals have a lot of concerns about, you know, the leaning of \u2014 of Fox News or conservatives have questions about the leaning of \u2014 of MSNBC let's say.\nIt seems to me that when you \u2014 when we get \u2014 whether it's from the right or the left, so I'm speaking to you for your platform, there's a great deal of cynicism in American society about government generally.\nAnd then when there is suspicions, legitimate or not, that maybe you're playing on one way unfairly towards the other, it seems to me that everything you can do to lean over backwards to make sure that you are fair in protecting political speech, right or left, that you ought to do it.\nAnd I'm not telling you how to do it, and I'm not saying you don't do it, but we've \u2014 we got to do something that reduces cynicism. At my town meetings in Iowa, I always get this question, how come you guys in D.C. can't get along?\nYou know, meaning Republicans and Democrats. Well I try to explain to them that they kind of get a obtuse \u2014 what would you say \u2014 review of what goes on here, because controversy makes news, so if people are getting along, you never hear about that.\nSo they get a distorted view of it, and \u2014 and really we \u2014 congressmen get along more than the public thinks. But these attitudes of the public, we've got to change and people of your position and your influence, you can do a lot to change this.\nWhether I know you got plenty time around your corporation, through your corporation or privately, anything you can do to reduce this cynicism because we have a \u2014 a perfect constitution, maybe it's not perfect, but we got a very good constitution \u2014 the longest one written constitution in the history of man \u2014 mankind.\nAnd \u2014 but if people don't have faith in the institutions of government, and then it's \u2014 it's our responsibility to enhance that faith so they have less cynicism in us, you know, we don't have a very strong democracy just because we've got a good constitution.",

I got to bend over backwards to do what I can so they don't \u2014 so I don't add to that cynicism.\nSo, I'm sorry you had to listen to me.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd so, this concludes today's hearing. Thanks to all the witnesses (sic) for attending.\nThe record will be open for 14 days for the members to submit additional written questions and for the witness, Mr. Zuckerberg, to make any corrections to his testimony.\nThe hearing is adjourned.",
