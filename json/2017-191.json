            "statement": "Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Our community continues to grow, now with nearly 2.1 billion people using Facebook every month, and nearly 1.4 billion people using it daily. Instagram also hit a big milestone this quarter, now with 500 million daily actives. And we saw good results in the business, where total revenue grew 47% year-overyear and we had our first quarter with more than $10 billion in revenue.\nBut none of that matters if our services are used in a way that don't bring people closer together -- or if the foundation of our society is undermined by foreign interference.\nI've expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust. We build these tools to help people connect and bring us closer together. And they used them to try to undermine our values. What they did is wrong and we're not going to stand for it.\nNow, for those who have followed Facebook, you know that when we set our minds to something, we're going to do it. It may be harder than we realize upfront, it may take longer, and we won't be perfect, but we will get it done. We're bringing the same intensity to these security issues that we've brought to any adversary or challenge that we've faced.\nThe first step is doing everything we can to help the US government get a complete picture of what happened. We've testified in congress over the past couple of days about the activity we found in last year's election. We're working with congress on legislation to make advertising more transparent. I think this would be very good if it\u2019s done well. And even without legislation, we're already moving on our own to bring advertising on Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency than ads on TV or other media. That's because in traditional media, there's no way to see all of the messages an advertiser is showing to different audiences. We're about to start rolling out a tool that lets you see all of the ads a page is running, and also an archive of ads political advertisers have run in the past.\nWe're also working with other tech companies to help identify and respond to new threats, because as we've now seen, if there's a national security threat involving the internet, it will affect many of the major tech companies. And we've announced a number of steps to help keep this kind of interference off our platform.\nThis is part of a much bigger focus on protecting the security and integrity of our platform and the safety of our community. It goes beyond elections and it means strengthening all of our systems to prevent abuse and harmful content.\nWe're doing a lot here with investments both in people and technology. Some of this is focused on finding bad actors and bad behavior. Some is focused on removing false news, hate speech, bullying, and other problematic content that we don't want in our community. We already have about 10,000 people working on safety and security, and we're planning to double that to 20,000 in the next year to better enforce our Community Standards and review ads. In many places, we're doubling or more our engineering efforts focused on security. And we're also building new AI to detect bad content and bad actors -- just like we've done with terrorist propaganda. I'm dead serious about this, and the reason I'm talking about this on our earnings call is that I've directed our teams to invest so much in security -- on top of the other investments we're making -- that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward, and I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me. I believe this will make our society stronger and in doing so will be good for all of us over the long term. But I want to be clear about what our priority is: protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.\nSo security and the integrity of our services will be a major focus. Beyond this, our focus is on building community. I talked about this last quarter when we changed our mission to focus on building community to bring the world closer together, and that's more important now than ever. And this gets into our roadmap for the next 3, 5 and 10 years.\nOver the next three years, the biggest trend in our products will be the growth of video. This goes both for sharing, where we've seen Stories in Instagram and Status in WhatsApp grow very quickly, each with more than 300 million daily actives, and also for consuming video content. We recently launched the Watch tab, where you can discover shows, follow creators, connect with people watching an episode, and join groups with people with similar interests to build the community.\nBut as video grows, it's important to remember that Facebook is about bringing people closer together and enabling meaningful social interactions; it's not primarily about consuming content passively. Research shows that interacting with friends and family on social media tends to be more meaningful and can be good for our well-being, and that's time well spent. But when we just passively consume content, that may be less true.\nWhen done well, video brings us closer together. We've found that communities formed around video like TV shows or sports create a greater sense of belonging than many other kinds of communities. We've found that Live videos generate 10x the number of interactions and comments as other videos. But too often right now, watching video is just a passive consumption experience. Time spent is not a goal by itself. We want the time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interactions. So we're going to focus our products on all the ways to build community around the video that people share and watch. That's something Facebook can uniquely do.\nMoving along, over the next five years, I expect us to make some good progress on several newer initiatives.\nIn messaging, today already more than 20 million businesses are communicating with customers through Messenger. Now we're starting to test business features that make it easier for people to make the same kinds of connections with businesses through WhatsApp.\nWe rolled out Marketplace to Canada and 17 countries across Europe, giving people the ability to discover, buy, and sell things in their local communities. Today more than 550 million people are using Marketplace and Buy-and-Sell groups on Facebook to connect with other people for transactions.\nWe're also seeing good progress with Workplace, helping companies connect their own teams internally through their own versions of Facebook. It's been less than a year since we launched Workplace, and today more than 30,000 companies are using it. This quarter, we welcomed on Walmart, the largest employer in the US.\nOver the next 10 years, we're working on the foundational technologies needed to bring the world closer together.\nI'm proud of the work we're doing with AI. We're now using machine learning in most of our integrity work to keep our community safe. When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, we used AI to look at satellite imagery and identify where people might live and need connectivity and other resources. Progress in AI can unlock a lot of opportunities, so this quarter we opened a new AI research lab in Montreal and we're building another lab in Paris as well.\nThis quarter we held Oculus Connect, and we announced Oculus Go -- our first ever all-in-one headset that's great for feeling like you're present with someone when you can't physically be together in person. It's great for playing games, watching movies, or hanging out with friends. At $199, we think it's going to help us bring great virtual reality experiences to more people. It ships next year.\nAt Connect, I also showed off our new Santa Cruz prototype -- which is the first time any company has shown the full experience of positional tracking in a standalone headset and controllers. It's a major technical achievement, and I'm looking forward to getting this into developers' hands next year. In order to support our community's growth, we need to keep investing in our infrastructure. This quarter, we broke ground on our new Albany data center, and we announced that we'll build our 11th major data center in Henrico County, Virginia. As always, all our new data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy.\nThese long term investments are important for our community's future. We can do a lot to help people connect through phones and computers, but so much more will be possible in a world where everyone has internet access, where AI improves all our services, and where we can basically teleport anywhere or be with anyone anytime we want.\nWith all the issues we face, it would be a lot to just invest in addressing those. But we know we also have a responsibility to deliver these fundamental technical and scientific advances to fulfill the promise of bringing people closer together, so we're going to keep making significant investments looking ahead towards the future too.\nWe've made some real progress this year. Across the board, we have a lot of work to deliver on our mission of bringing the world closer together, but we're committed to rising to the challenge and doing what we need to for our community. Thanks to all of you for being part of this journey, and I'm looking forward to the road ahead.\nAnd now, here's Sheryl to discuss our business.",

            "speaker": "Sheryl Sandberg",
            "statement": "Thanks Mark and hi everyone.\nWe had a strong third quarter with growth across all regions, marketer segments and verticals. Ad revenue grew 49% year over year. Mobile ad revenue was $8.9 billion \u2014 a 57% year over year increase \u2014 making up approximately 88% of total ad revenue. We\u2019re continuing to build our business by focusing on our same three priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile, developing new ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.\nToday we\u2019re announcing that Facebook has over 6 million active advertisers, and we recently announced that Instagram has over 2 million advertisers. The vast majority of these are small and medium sized businesses, which are a major source of innovation and create more than half of all new jobs globally. These businesses often have small ad budgets, so the ability to reach people more effectively is really valuable to them. A great example is Lovebook, a small business in Michigan which lets you make personalized books for the people you love. During a recent campaign, they used Facebook ads to reach people getting ready to celebrate their first anniversary. They\u2019ve grown so much from marketing on Facebook that they\u2019ve been able to hire 10 new employees this year alone. We are proud of the role we are playing in enabling businesses like Lovebook to reach people on mobile, to grow, and to create jobs.\nOne of our strongest areas this quarter was SMBs in Europe, with revenue growing more than 60% yearover- year. When I was in Germany two months ago, I had a chance to meet Victor, one of the cofounders of Brooklyn Soap Company, which despite its name is based in Hamburg. Victor and his friends came up with the idea for their business while staying in a hostel in Brooklyn. Now they sell their grooming products in 38 countries using mobile video ads on Facebook and Instagram. As a result, their sales increased 62% over the last year. They\u2019re one of many small businesses using mobile to find new customers and grow across borders.\nOur second priority is developing innovative ad products. Video is exploding, and mobile video advertising is a big opportunity. Until recently, ads were only eligible for Ad Breaks if they also ran in News Feed. In Q3, we gave advertisers the option to run ads in videos alone. We\u2019re seeing good early results, with >70% of ad breaks up to 15 seconds in length on Facebook and Audience Network viewed to completion, most with the sound on.\nAs Mark said, Instagram Stories are growing well, too. People and businesses are finding creative new ways to use full screen vertical video in Stories. This quarter we gave advertisers even more flexibility in the content, format and reach of their ads in Stories.\nWe\u2019re also seeing how immersive video and images can help people discover new products on Facebook. We added a new creative template to Collection Ads, which helps retailers bring their catalogs online. West Elm, a home d\u00e9cor company, recently used this template to promote its furniture and home accessories. They targeted people who already get their physical catalog and saw a 5.5% lift in purchases in stores.\nOur third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. In Q3 we introduced new tools powered by machine-learning and automation to help businesses reach people more likely to spend with them. We also simplified the tools for creating ads, making it easier for businesses of all sizes to advertise with us.\nIt\u2019s important for all businesses to reach the right audience \u2014 but it\u2019s especially important for small businesses that have limited budgets. Targeting allows them to show ads only to the people they want to reach. Neon Retro Arcade in LA is a great example. They advertise to people within 10 miles of their location who are interested in video games and comic books. Last year, they moved their entire ad budget to Facebook and Instagram, and their revenue is up 25%.\nRelevance and effectiveness are also about giving businesses more control over where their ads run. In Q3 we clarified which publishers and creators can include ads next to their content. This is good for creators, who want guidance on how to earn money from their content on Facebook \u2013 and it\u2019s good for advertisers, who want transparency and control to make the right decisions for their brands. We\u2019re also working to give advertisers more clarity on where their ads were shown, so they can make more informed choices about where to run them in the future.\nI want to close by talking about what we\u2019re doing to protect our platform and help ensure that the ads and content people see on Facebook and Instagram are legitimate and authentic.\nWhen I was in Washington a few weeks ago, I made clear that we are determined to do everything we can do to minimize abuse going forward. As Mark said, we\u2019re investing heavily in new technology and people to review ads and posts. This will enable us to look more closely at the content of the ads, targeting, and the advertiser who submits them \u2013 as well as tighten our ads policies, particularly for ads directed at social and political issues. We believe that ads are important to free expression and we will continue to accept ads on issues -- but we will also do our part to elevate the quality of that discourse.\nTransparency helps everyone keep advertisers accountable for their messages. We\u2019re working with Congress on new requirements for online political advertising, but we\u2019re not waiting for legislation. We\u2019re building a tool now that will allow anyone to see the ads a Page is running, even if those ads are not targeted to them. We will test it soon in Canada and then in the US in the coming months. For ads related to US federal elections, we'll start sharing even more information, including an archive of past ads, total amount spent, and demographics about the people the ads reached. We\u2019re also going to require more thorough documentation from these advertisers \u2014 and we'll label their ads so it\u2019s clear who paid for them. We believe these actions will set a new standard for transparency in online ads.\nBecause the interference on our platform went beyond ads, we\u2019re also increasing transparency around organic content from Pages. We\u2019re looking at ways to provide more information about who is behind a political or issue-based Facebook Page. We believe this will make it harder for deceptive Pages to gain large followings and make it easier for us to identify malicious activity.\nWe are all committed to getting this right, and to investing in strengthening our platform so we can better serve our community. We are also committed to continuing to help businesses all over the world attract customers, sell their products, and create jobs.\nAs always, I am grateful to all of our clients for their partnership and to our global Facebook teams for their hard work.\nThanks, and now here\u2019s Dave.",

            "statement": "Thanks Sheryl, and good afternoon everyone.\nQ3 was another great quarter for Facebook. We saw continued growth and engagement in our community as well as strong performance in our ads business.\nLet\u2019s begin with our community metrics.\nDaily active users in Q3 reached 1.37 billion, up 16% compared to last year. This number represents 66% of our 2.07 billion monthly active users in Q3. MAUs were up 284 million year-over-year or 16%.\nOur community growth was again driven by product improvements, promotional data plans, and Internet.org. Note that in Q3 we began to lap the introduction of promotional data plans from mobile operators in markets like India.\nBefore going to the financials, let me touch briefly on our ongoing efforts to improve our user estimates. This quarter, we implemented a new methodology to help identify duplicate accounts. As a result, we increased our estimates for duplicate accounts to approximately 10% of worldwide MAUs from our previously disclosed estimate of 6%. Duplicate accounts are those that we believe are used by the same person and represent real activity and engagement on Facebook.\nWe have also increased our estimate for inauthentic accounts to approximately 2-3% of worldwide MAUs. Inauthentic accounts are largely those that are used for spam and other policy-violating reasons. We continuously monitor and aggressively take down those accounts. These accounts tend to be less active and thus we believe impact DAU less than MAU.\nNow turning now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.\nQ3 total revenue was $10.3 billion, up 47% or 45% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tailwinds contributed $128 million of revenue in Q3.\nQ3 total ad revenue was $10.1 billion, up 49%. On a constant currency basis, our ad revenue growth rate was 47%, down 2 percentage points compared to the growth in Q2.\nAd revenue growth was strong globally, led by Europe and APAC with 56% and 54% growth respectively.\nMobile ad revenue was $8.9 billion, up 57%.\nIn Q3, the average price per ad increased 35% and the number of ad impressions served increased 10%, driven primarily by feed ads on Facebook and Instagram. I would note that, compared to a year ago, price is a much more important driver of our ads revenue growth.\nPayments & Other Fees revenue was $186 million, down 5%.\nTotal expenses were $5.2 billion, up 34%.\nQ3 was our biggest hiring quarter ever. We added over 2,500 people and ended the quarter with over 23,000 employees, up 47% compared to last year.\nOperating income was $5.1 billion, representing a 50% operating margin.\nOur tax rate in the third quarter was 10%. Excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our effective tax rate by 6 percentage points, a level that was driven by appreciation in our stock price.\nNet income was $4.7 billion or one dollar and fifty-nine cents per share.\nYear-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, office facilities and network infrastructure.\nIn Q3, we generated over $4.3 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with over $38 billion in cash and investments.\nYear-to-date, we have bought back over $1 billion of our Class A common stock.\nTurning now to the revenue outlook.\nOur ads business remains strong. But it\u2019s worth noting that in Q3, our year-over-year ad revenue growth rates decelerated for the fifth consecutive quarter on a constant currency basis, and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.\nGoing forward, we also expect the growth in advertising revenue will increasingly be driven by price. This is a shift from prior years when growth was primarily driven by increases in supply.\nTurning now to expenses.\nWe anticipate that our full-year 2017 total expenses will grow approximately 35-40% versus our prior range of 40-45%.\nWe anticipate that full-year 2017 capital expenditures will be approximately $7 billion.\nAs mentioned previously, our tax rate will vary based on our stock price. At the current stock price, we would expect that the Q4 rate will be in the low teens.\nI also wanted to provide some comments on 2018 expenses and capital expenditures.\nPlease recognize that these are preliminary estimates as we have not yet finalized our 2018 budget. That said, it is shaping up to be a significant investment year, and I wanted to provide initial guidance to align investors with our most current thinking. We expect full-year 2018 total expenses will grow approximately 45-60% compared to full-year 2017.\nWe continue to invest aggressively across the business, but there are three important factors driving an acceleration in our expense growth rates from 2017 levels. First, as Mark outlined in his earlier comments, we are making sizeable security investments in people and technology to strengthen our systems and prevent abuse.\nSecondly, we are investing aggressively in video content to support the Watch tab.\nFinally, we continue to invest in our long-term initiatives around augmented and virtual reality, AI, and connectivity.\nGiven our expectation of continued deceleration in revenue growth rates, we expect these significant investments will be net negative on our operating margins.\nIn addition, we expect to make substantial investments in our infrastructure to support growth and improve our products. As such, we expect full-year 2018 capital expenditures will roughly double from 2017 levels.\nWe would also anticipate that the full-year 2018 tax rate will be in the mid-teens.\nIn summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook across the board. We are excited about the opportunities we see ahead and we will continue to make significant investments to support our growth and our mission.\nWith that, Mike, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.",

So hopefully, the experience on Facebook will not just be that you come and watch a video and you get informed, you feel entertained and that's it; we think that the most valuable thing that people do are help build relationships with other people on the platform. To the extent that the -- that video can serve as a touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then that's a thing that we feel like we can uniquely do. So we're going to continue investing heavily in video content for Watch. That is centered on people, that is centered around things that people want to talk and connect around, that give people sense of pride and bring people together. We're going to invest as much in just making sure that we build out the community features around that. And that, I think, is going to be the thing that differentiates this over time.",

I wonder if you could step back, could you talk to any areas or any verticals where you really see the potential for material improvements or verticals you're having a hard time cracking into that you think it really be bigger drivers of ad revenue growth going forward?",

            "statement": "For my part, when I think about our marketer segments -- we have SMBs, we have brand, direct response and developers -- we're seeing strong growth across. I think if you think about where the growth remains, it really is in increasing the relevance of the ads.\nBecause the ads, I think, are getting better in terms of reaching the right people at the right time, but I think there's still a lot more we can do. And as people really use our Custom Audiences, our targeting tools, the quality of the ads improves and the returns improve and the more -- the better we get at measuring those returns, the better the ads get. And so I'll share just one example but one I really love, which is the Alameda County Fair, which is a local fairground in Pleasanton, California.\nI happened to meet this woman, Angel, who's running their marketing this year. And they used Facebook to target people within 25 miles of their fair grounds aged 20 to 51 who had specific interest in concerts, music, festivals and theme parks. And what they saw for season pass ticket sales for 2017 was a 50 percent increase compared to 2016, and they attribute that to Facebook. And that's really about finding the people that are interested.\nAnd if you look at the percentage of our ads business where people are using our most sophisticated approaches to finding the right audience, I think we still have a lot of opportunity for growth there. And that will improve both the quality of the ads people see but also the returns to marketers. And I think that will hit all of the verticals and all of the segments.",

One of the real consistencies of the business is OpEx growth; you've been growing that at $4 to $5 billion incremental in spend per year, but the midpoint of your guidance is looking like a $14 billion increase next year. Is the differential there -- the additional $6-7 billion -- should we be thinking of that as -- of your video content spend that you're setting aside possibly to spend next year? Just trying to understand where the significant increase would be coming from.\nAnd then related, the 35 percent increase in ad prices. Would you say that, that's predominantly being driven, the acceleration there, by the mix towards video ad breaks and other longer-form video ads? Thanks.",

On the acceleration of the growth rate in expenses from 2017 to 2018, I would really look at the sort of -- the growth rate that we grew at in 2017, apply that to the total expense faced and look at that growth in 2018. And then I would say the additional expense that leads to the acceleration is driven by 3 factors, not just 1 factor. And those 3 factors are the ones that I outlined in my commentary -- number one, the substantial investments that Mark highlighted that we're making to just improve the security on our platform; two, the video content investments we're making for Watch Tab; and then 3, additional investments we're making in the long-term initiatives like AR/VR, AI and connectivity. And each of those are significant so it's really the combination of those 3 factors that's driving the expense growth acceleration.\nAnd then on the 35 percent increases in ad prices, this is really being driven off of a couple of things. One is just the auction dynamic, which has -- as supply growth has slowed, then there's more competition, and you're seeing prices increase as demand continues to grow. But I think what is important here is we've been getting better and better at targeting as we optimize for real business results for advertisers, and we're better at converting the signals that we get from those advertisers into finding the right ad spots for them. And I think that's really what's allowing us to improve yield and effectively driving higher effective CPMs for us while still delivering business outcomes to them at attractive ROIs.\nThat's really what's driving it; not a shift to a different format like video. It's really about us getting better at targeting and working with those -- especially people where we get those downstream signals like direct response advertisers.",

Was hoping you could just help us understand, is that 10,000 fully in the 23,000 headcount that you have today or is there a part of it that's not included in there perhaps because it's not full-time?\nAnd then just secondly, just going back to the ad pricing changes. Dave, just to clarify on that, I mean, it sounds like what you're saying is it's not that advertisers across the board are seeing that substantial of an increase in pricing but that's more an output in your eCPM; is that the right way to think about it?

That's a fully loaded number; that's also in the OpEx guidance as well. But yes, you can\u2019t compare the 10,000 to the 23,000 directly.\nOn the ad pricing, what you're seeing is that most of the advertising that we get isn't necessarily bid on an impression basis; you're getting people bidding for other actions and optimizing against other actions like a click to a website or a downstream e-commerce transaction and app install, and our ability to optimize the inventory that we have against those downstream activities allows us to deliver those at still good prices while seeing effective CPMs go up.\nYou do have obviously people who are bidding on impressions if they're looking for like a brand campaign or reach campaign, but those aren't necessarily part of the business that's driving up prices. It's more around just us doing a better job at being able to optimize campaigns for people who have downstream activities that we can do that for.",

And today, most of that is in News Feed. But most people who come to News Feed and who come to Facebook today, in general, are trying to figure out -- they're trying to see what's going on with their friends, see what's happening in the world; they're not coming necessarily to engage in a specific type of video or specific community around video.\nThe Watch Tab is mainly -- it's a way to give people a tool to do that. When they want to specifically come and engage around video or communities around that, they can go to the Watch Tab; the intent there is different. Now in order to build that up, we think it makes sense to first invest in a bunch of Lighthouse content -- some that we may produce or some that we may license. To get to your question, we're pretty agnostic on how that goes. We just want to start the flywheel going so that way there\u2019s content and communities that are there that support this use case of people coming to Facebook specifically to engage in that.\nLong term, our hope is that the business here will primarily be through revenue shares of videos that normal creators and businesses put into the system rather than ones that we proactively go out and license ourselves. That's a look at the where we're trying to get on this but first, we need to build this behavior where people want to come intentionally to engage with this content.

            "statement": "I'll talk about video engagement and then Dave can jump in on some of the stats. One of the important points here that I tried to communicate in my comments upfront is that connecting with friends and family and having those meaningful interactions is more important than just consuming content, right? Video is growing incredibly quickly, and that goes across both social content and kind of more passive public consumption of content. And they create different dynamics in the system and I think that's an important thing to understand.\nWhen your friend posts something and you get to engage with it, it might inform you and entertain you, but you also -- if you interact with it you're building a relationship with that person, right? You feel closer to that person. And that is a really important part of what social networking is supposed to do.\nWhereas when you engage with public content, you might get informed or be entertained, but it's not necessarily increasing social capital in the same way or building relationships between people. We really differentiate what the core thing is that we're trying to do -- which is help people connect with each other and build meaningful relationships -- and that's why on a lot of these calls, I emphasize products like Instagram Stories or WhatsApp Status, which are very video-based products but they're improving social interactions.\nAnd we're going to focus a lot more on helping people share videos of their moment in their lives because in a lot of ways, I think if you take a video of yourself and your family out Trick or Treating, that's more engaging than a photo and a better representation of that than writing it out in text.\nBut overall, I would say not all time spent is created equal. That's why I tried to stress upfront that time spent is not a goal by itself here; what we really want to go for is time well spent. And what the research that we found shows is that when you're actually engaging with people and having meaningful connections, that's time well spent and that's the thing that we want to focus on. Out of this big video thing that's growing very quickly, I think that is the real opportunity and product area that we should be focused on more. And to the extent that there is going to be a lot of public content -- which there will be -- a big part of the focus is going to be around building community and interactions around that content.",

We can continue to grow engagement on core Facebook as well as there's opportunities with Instagram and the other services that we have that are not monetizing significantly today. There's opportunities there.\nBut most importantly, kind of I would go back to the fact that we're getting better at -- on the ad product side -- of being able to optimize our inventory for the advertisers in a way that will we think, drive good pricing in the system for us and get outcomes for the advertisers. We do think that, that will lead to the potential for additional revenue growth in the U.S.",

Is the deceleration you guys are seeing around impression growth right now a function of promoting video in the feed versus what else -- other things that might be in there?

Overall, that story has played out sort of as we thought, and that's one of the reasons you're seeing the impression growth come down.\nAnd then yes, I do think that there are less impressions when people are consuming video, so that also is a factor as more time is spent on video. I think you have both of those factors coming into play. In terms of how those play out going forward, hard to say. We just kind of point to our overall comments on just continued revenue growth deceleration.\nAnd I believe the first question was whether the security investments would have an adverse impact on engagement \u2026",

And we're going to invest both in people and technology because we think that both are really important parts of the solution here to go after all different parts of these problems. And that was what I tried to stress earlier on.\nWe're going from 10,000 people working on safety and security to more than doubling that to 20,000. We're building -- we're doubling, in some cases, more our engineering teams focused on security. We're building AI to go after more different areas of harmful content and finding fake accounts and other bad actors in the system.\nAnd I expect that all of these things will make our product better over the long term, but we will incur the expenses a lot sooner as we ramp up these efforts. And I also just think that going forward, we're going to investigate these things at a much higher level because we realize that it's an important -- not only for our community and this company -- but it's part of our responsibility to society overall.",

How do you balance what type of content business you ultimately want to build? And then when you look at sports, which I also think about as being kind of really relevant content that has a huge community around it -- something like the NFL mobile rights, I think, come up next year -- wondering how important are those types of -- or how important is that type of content?

We will probably experiment with a number of different things.\nI do think your point is right that not all kinds of content can be supported by ads no matter how effective we make that. That said, the current model that we have for at least getting some of the Lighthouse content onto the platform is to pay upfront. And what we would like to transition that more to over time and want an increasing amount of the content is, is revenue shares for ads shown in the video. And as we do better and better on the monetization there, that will support people with higher production costs and doing more premium production and bringing their content to the platform.\nAnd we've certainly found on the Internet and YouTube and in other places that there are whole industries around creators with different cost structures than traditional Hollywood folks who can produce very informative and engaging content that a lot of people like, enjoy and that builds communities and helps people connect together in a way that definitely can be supported by this ad model. I think the answer is we're going to try a bunch of things. That's a bunch of what the budget is. I'm very optimistic that a lot of the stuff will be able to be supported long term, but you're certainly right that not all of it will be able to be supported by ad models alone.",

And so one of the opportunities we have here is increasing inventory. And it's particularly good inventory for marketers because we're seeing nice adoption of video views and really nice impact from those sales.\nAnd it's also the case that our ad products work together.

And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has different strength than people do, right? The AI tools that we've built can enable a system to look at millions of pieces of content and make rough assessments on them and figure out what to flag for people. But ultimately, if you want to get those high-quality judgments today on sensitive content and you want to do with quickly when the stakes are pretty high in terms of taking down content or leaving things up, I mean, we take that extremely seriously, you want people to be looking at that.\nEarlier in the year, when we were working on problems like seeing issues when people were going live, right? There was this really serious issue around people with self-harm and, in some cases, suicide on Live. And we made an investment in AI tools and in dramatically increasing the staffing of the team that was working on that and brought the amount of time to review those live videos down through a combination of those things to I think it's under 10 minutes now. That might still be a conservative estimate. And we're continuing to work on that.\nNow what we're trying to do is just increase the SLAs that we have across all of these different types of content and security threats that we might see so that way, through a combination of the AI tooling that we build and having people to look at these things, we can get it right faster for more of the types of content.\nAnd you're definitely right that a lot of the AI research that we do is applicable to multiple areas, but we still need to build those tools. It takes a lot of engineering investment and we will be prioritizing that, in some cases, by adding people to teams and in other cases, by trading off and doing more security work instead of other product work that we might have done.

You guys unbundled the video buy; can you speak to pricing -- relative to that 35 percent average increase in ad pricing -- can you maybe just help us understand the disparity that exists today between pricing on the new video platform and the legacy video platform? Thank you.",

The pricing is really about what is the pricing that you're seeing in the overall system, primarily given on the feed-based products. That's really what the driver is and again there, I would point to the comments that I made about getting better at targeting and driving towards good outcomes for our advertisers as being kind of the reason that we've been able to support higher prices.",
