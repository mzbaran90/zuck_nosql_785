In addition, as you will recall, to this morning's Facebook hearing, later today, our Health Subcommittee will hold its third in the series of legislative hearings on solutions to combat the opioid crisis.\n\nAnd, remember, Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee will hold a hearing where we will get an update on the restoration of Puerto Rico's electric infrastructure following last year's hurricane season.\n\n\nSo, just a reminder: When this hearing concludes, I think we have votes on the House floor. Our intent is to get through every \u2014 every member before that point, to be able to ask questions. But then, after the votes, we will come back into our subcommittees to do that work. As Ray Baum used to say, \u201cThe fun never stops.\u201d\n\n[Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg survived 10 hours of questioning by Congress]\n\nThe chair now recognizes himself for five minutes for purposes of an opening statement.\n\nGood morning. Welcome, Mr. Zuckerberg, to the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House. We've called you here today for two reasons. One is to examine the alarming reports regarding breaches of trust between your company, one of the biggest and most powerful in the world, and its users. And the second reason is to widen our lens to larger questions about the fundamental relationship tech companies have with their users.\n\n\nThe incident involving Cambridge Analytica and the compromised personal information of approximately 87 million American users \u2014 or mostly American users \u2014 is deeply disturbing to this committee. The American people are concerned about how Facebook protects and profits from its users' data.\n\nIn short, does Facebook keep its end of the agreement with its users? How should we, as policymakers, evaluate and respond to these events? Does Congress need to clarify whether or not consumers own or have any real power over their online data? Have edge providers grown to the point that they need federal supervision?\n\nYou and your co-founders started a company in your dorm room that's grown to one \u2014 be one of the biggest and most successful businesses in the entire world.\n\nThrough innovation and quintessentially American entrepreneurial spirit, Facebook and the tech companies that have flourished in Silicon Valley join the legacy of great American companies who built our nation, drove our economy forward, and created jobs and opportunity. And you did it all without having to ask permission from the federal government and with very little regulatory involvement.\n\n\nThe company you created disrupted entire industries and has become an integral part of our daily lives. Your success story is an American success story, embodying our shared values of freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of enterprise.\n\nFacebook also provides jobs for thousands of Americans, including my own congressional district, with data centers in Prineville. Many of our constituents feel a genuine sense of pride and gratitude for what you've created, and you're rightly considered one of the era's greatest entrepreneurs.\n\nThis unparalleled achievement is why we look to you with a special sense of obligation and hope for deep introspection. While Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it may not have matured. I think it's time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\n\n\nThere are critical unanswered questions surrounding Facebook's business model and the entire digital ecosystem regarding online privacy and consumer protection. What exactly is Facebook? Social platform? Data company? Advertising company? A media company? A common carrier in the information age? All of the above? Or something else?",

            "statement": "Users trust Facebook with a great deal of information; their name, home town, email, phone number, photos, private messages, and much, much more. But, in many instances, users are not purposefully providing Facebook with data. Facebook collects this information while users simply browse other websites, shop online or use a third-party app.\n\nPeople are willing to share quite a bit about their lives online, based on the belief they can easily navigate and control privacy settings and trust that their personal information is in good hands. If a company fails to keep its promises about how personal data are being used, that breach of trust must have consequences.\n\n\nToday we hope to shed light on Facebook's policies and practices surrounding third-party access to and use of user data. We also hope you can help clear up the considerable confusion that exists about how people's Facebook data are used outside of the platform.\n\nWe hope you can help Congress, but, more importantly, the American people better understand how Facebook user information has been accessed by third parties, from Cambridge Analytica and Cubeyou, to the Obama for America presidential campaign.\n\nAnd we ask that you share any suggestions you have for ways policymakers can help reassure our constituents that data they believe was only shared with friends or certain groups remains private to those circles.\n\nAs policymakers, we want to be sure that consumers are adequately informed about how their online activities and information are used. These issues apply not just to Facebook, but equally to the other internet-based companies that collect information about users online.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Zuckerberg, your expertise in this field is without rival. So thank you for joining us today to help us learn more about these vital matters and to answer our questions.\n\nWith that, I yield now to the gentleman from New Jersey, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, my friend, Mr. Pallone, for five minutes for purposes of an opening statement.",

            "statement": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I also want to thank you Mr. Zuckerberg for being here today.\n\nFacebook has become integral to our lives. We don't just share pictures of our families, we use it to connect for school, to organize events and to watch baseball games.\n\nFacebook has enabled everyday people to spur national political movements. Most of us in Congress use Facebook to reach our constituents in ways that were unimaginable 10 years ago, and this is certainly a good thing.\n\n\nBut it also means that many of us can't give it up easily. Many businesses have their only web presence on Facebook, and, for professions like journalism, people's jobs depend on posting on the site.\n\nAnd this ubiquity comes with a price; for all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for those, like Russia and Cambridge Analytica, that seek to harm us and hack our democracy.\n\nFacebook made it too easy for a single person \u2014 in this instance, Aleksandr Kogan \u2014 to get extensive personal information about 87 million people. He sold this data \u2014 Cambridge Analytical [sic] \u2014 who used it to try to sway the 2016 presidential election for the Trump campaign.\n\nAnd Facebook made itself a powerful tool for things like voter suppression, in part by opening its platform to app developers with little or no oversight.\n\n\nBut it gets worse. The fact is no one knows how many people have access to the Cambridge Analytical [sic] data, and no one knows how many other Cambridge Analyticas are still out there.\n\nShutting down access to data to third parties isn't enough, in my opinion. Facebook and many other companies are doing the same thing: They're using people's personal information to do highly targeted product and political advertising.\n\nAnd Facebook is just the latest in a never-ending string of companies that vacuum up our data, but fail to keep it safe. And this incident demonstrates yet again that our laws are not working.\n\nMaking matters worse, Republicans here in Congress continue to block or even repeal the few privacy protections we have. In this era of nonstop data breaches, last year, Republicans eliminated existing privacy and data security protections at the FCC.",

            "statement": "And their justification that those protections were not needed because the Federal Trade Commission has everything under control \u2014 well, this latest disaster shows just how wrong the Republicans are.\n\nThe FTC used every tool Republicans have been willing to give it, and those tools weren't enough. And that's why Facebook acted like so many other companies, and reacted only when it got bad press.\n\nWe all know this cycle by now. Our data is stolen. The company looks the other way. Eventually, reporters find out, publish a negative story, and the company apologizes. And Congress then holds a hearing, and then nothing happens.\n\nBy not doing its job, this Republican-controlled Congress has become complicit in this nonstop cycle of privacy by press release. And this cycle must stop, because the current system is broken.\n\nSo I was happy to hear that Mr. Zuckerberg conceded that his industry needs to be regulated, and I agree. We need comprehensive privacy and data security legislation.\n\nWe need baseline protections that stretch from Internet service providers, to data brokers, to app developers and to anyone else who makes a living off our data. We need to figure out how to make sure these companies act responsibly, even before the press finds out.\n\nBut, while securing our privacy is necessary, it's not sufficient. We need to take steps immediately to secure our democracy. We can't let what happened in 2016 happen again.\n\nAnd, to do that, we need to learn how Facebook was caught so flat-footed in 2016. How was it so blind to what the Russians and others were doing on its systems? Red flags were everywhere. Why didn't anyone see them? Or were they ignored?\n\nSo today's hearing is a good start. But we also need to hold additional hearings where we hold accountable executives from other tech companies, Internet service providers, data brokers and anyone else that collects our information.\n\nNow, Congresswoman Schakowsky from Illinois and I introduced a bill last year that would require companies to implement baseline data security standards. And I plan to work with my colleagues to draft additional legislation.\n\nBut I have to, say Mr. Chairman, it's time for this committee and this Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to prevent incidents like this in the future.\n\nMy great fear is that we have this hearing today, there's a lot of press attention \u2014 and, Mr. Zuckerberg, you know, appreciate your being here once again \u2014 but, if all we do is have a hearing and then nothing happens, then that's not accomplishing anything.\n\nAnd \u2014 and I \u2014 you know, I know I sound very critical of the Republicans and their leadership on this \u2014 on these privacy issues. But I've just seen it \u2014 I've just seen it over and over again \u2014 that we have the hearings, and nothing happens. So excuse me for being so pessimistic, Mr. Chairman, but that's where I am.\n\nI yield back.",

And you will rightfully have some hard questions for me to answer.\n\nBefore I talk about the steps we're taking to address them, I want to talk for a minute about how we got there. Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most of our existence, we focused on all the good that connecting people can bring.\n\nAnd, as Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they care about most, for making their voices heard and for building community and businesses.\n\nJust recently, we've seen the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement and the March for Our Lives organized, at least part, on Facebook. After Hurricane Harvey, people came together and raised more than $20 million for relief. And there are more than 70 million small businesses around the world that use our tools to grow and create jobs.",

            "statement": "But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm, as well. And that goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy. We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake.\n\nIt was my mistake, and I am sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and, at the end of the day, I am responsible for what happens here. So, now, we have to go through every part of our relationship with people to make sure that we're taking a broad enough view of our responsibility.\n\nIt's not enough to just connect people. We have to make sure those connections are positive. It's not enough to just give people a voice. We need to make sure that voice isn't used to harm other people or spread misinformation. And it's not enough to just give people control of their information. We need to make sure that the developers that they share it with protect their information too.\n\nAcross the board, we have a responsibility to not just give people tools, but to make sure that those tools are used for good.\n\nIt's going to take some time to work through all the changes we need to make. But I am committed to getting this right, and that includes the basic responsibility of protecting people's information, which we failed to do with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nSo here are a few key things that we're doing to address this situation and make sure that this doesn't happen again.\n\nFirst, we're getting to the bottom of exactly what Cambridge Analytica did, and telling everyone who may have been affected. What we know now is that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained some information about millions of Facebook members by buying it from an app developer that people had shared it with.\n\nThis information was generally information that people share publicly on their profile pages, like their name and profile picture and the list of pages that they follow. When we first contacted Cambridge Analytica, they told us that they had deleted the data. And then, about a month ago, we heard a new report that suggested that this was not true.\n\nSo now we're working with governments in the U.S., the U.K. and around the world to do a full audit of what they've done and to make sure that they get rid of any data that they still have.\n\nSecond, to make sure that no other app developers are out there misusing data, we're now investigating every single app that had access to a large amount of people's information on Facebook in the past. And, if we find someone that improperly used data, we're going to ban them from our platform and tell everyone affected.\n\nThird, to prevent this from ever happening again, we're making sure developers can't access as much information, going forward. The good news here is that we made some big changes to our platform in 2014 that would prevent this specific instance with Cambridge Analytica from happening again today.\n\nBut there's more to do, and you can find more of the details of the other steps we're taking in the written statement I provided.\n\nMy top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community and bringing the world closer together. Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that for as long as I am running Facebook.\n\nI started Facebook when I was in college. We've come a long way since then. We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world, and, every day, people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most.\n\nI believe deeply in what we're doing, and I know that, when we address these challenges, we'll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world.\n\nI realize the issues we're talking about today aren't just issues for Facebook and our community; they're challenges for all of us as Americans. Thank you for having me here today, and I am ready to take your questions.",

Remember, it's four minutes today, so we can get to everyone.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg, you've described Facebook as a company that connects people and as a company that's idealistic and optimistic. I have a few questions about what other types of companies Facebook may be.\n\nFacebook has created its own video series, starring Tom Brady, that ran for six episodes and has over 50 million views. That's twice the number of the viewers that watched the Oscars last month. Also, Facebook's obtained exclusive broadcasting rights for 25 major league baseball games this season.\n\nIs Facebook a media company?",

We track certain information for security reasons and for ads reasons.\n\nFor security, it's to make sure that people who are not signed into Facebook can't scrape people's public information. You can \u2014 even when you're not signed in, you can look up the information that people have chosen to make public on their page, because they wanted to share it with everyone. So there's no reason why you should have to be logged in.\n\nBut, nonetheless, we don't want someone to be able to go through and download every single public piece of information. Even if someone chose to make it public, that doesn't mean that it's good to allow someone to aggregate it. So, even if someone isn't logged in, we track certain information, like how many pages they're accessing, as a security measure.\n\nThe second thing that we do is we provide an ad network that third-party websites and apps can run in order to help them make money. And those ads \u2014 you know, similar to what Google does and what the rest of the industry does \u2014 it's not limited to people who are just on Facebook.\n\nSo, for the purposes of that, we may also collect information to make it so that those ads are more relevant and work better on those websites. There's a control that \u2014 for that second class of information around ad targeting \u2014 anyone can turn off, has complete control over it.\n\nFor obvious reasons, we do not allow people to turn off the \u2014 the measurement that we do around security.",

Thanks for being here.\n\nWhen I first got into public office, the Internet was really kicking off, and I had a lot of people complain about ads, just the inconvenience of ads, trying to get the \u2014 and the cumbersome of the Internet. I remember telling someone one time, being from Kentucky, a basketball fan. I said \u201cThere's nothing I hate worse than the four-minute timeout, the TV timeout. It's flow of the game, and everything.

But it's being used in the \u2014 in the right way, and it's \u2014 it's funny, because I was going to ask this question anyway. My \u2014 my friend and I was planning a family trip to Florida, and I searched a town in Florida, and all of a sudden, I started getting ads for a brand of hotel that I typically stay in, and a great hotel at the price available to the public, because it was on the Internet, that I was willing to pay and stay there. So I thought it was actually convenient. Instead of getting just an ad to someplace I'll never go, I got an ad specifically to a place I was \u2014 I was looking to go, so I thought that was convenient. And it wasn't Facebook, although my wife used Facebook to message my mother-in-law this weekend for where we're meeting up, so it's very valuable. We get to do that for free, because your business model relies on consumer-driven data.\n\nThis wasn't Facebook. It was a search engine, but they use consumer \u2014 consumer-driven data to target an ad to me, so you're not unique in Silicon Valley, or in this Internet world in doing this type of targeted ads, are you?",

One is that we already give people a control to not use that data and ads, if they want. Most people don't do that.

They see \u2014 fed positive information to one group, and, another group, negative information.\n\nThe goal was to see how the tone of these posts would affect behavior. I look at this Forbes article, the L.A. Times, about un-legal \u2014 illegal human experimentation without permission. I want to talk about that.\n\nIt seems that this is disconnecting people, in stark contrast to your mission to connect people.

We don't want to have it so that \u2014 we want use of social media and our products to be good for people's well-being.\n\nI mean, we continually make changes to \u2014 to that effect, including, just recently, this year, we did a number of research projects that showed that when social media is used for building relationships \u2014 and so when you're interacting with people, it's associated with a lot of positive effects of \u2014 of well-being that you'd expect. It \u2014 it makes you feel more connected, less lonely, it correlates with long term measures of happiness and health.\n\nWhereas if you're using social media or the Internet just to passively consume content, then that doesn't have those same positive effects or can even be negative.

One are basically spammers. They're economic actors, like \u2014 like the Macedonian trolls that I think we have all heard about \u2014 basically, folks who do not have an ideological goal. They're just trying to write the most sensational thing they can, in order to get people to click on it so they can make money on ads. It's all economics.\n\nSo the way to fight that is we make it so they can't run our ads, they can't make money. We make it so we can detect what they're doing and show it in less in news feeds, so they can make less money. When they stop making money, they just go and do something else, because they're economically inclined.\n\nThe second category are basically state actors, right, so what we've found with Russian interference. And those people are setting up fake accounts. So, for that, we need to build A.I. systems that can go and identify a number of their fake account networks.\n\nAnd, just last week, we traced back the Russian activity to \u2014 to specific \u2014 a fake account network that Russia had in Russia to influence Russian culture and other Russian-speaking countries around them.\n\nAnd we took down a number of their fake accounts and pages, including a news organization that was sanctioned by Russian \u2014 by the Russian government as a Russian state news organization. So that's a pretty big action. But removing fake accounts is the other way that we can fake \u2014 stop the spread of false information.",

As far as we know, the dam is still broken.\n\nAs you have noted, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook's business model is based on capitalizing on the private personal information of your users.

I'm certain there are other things you'd rather be doing.\n\nThe activities of Facebook and other technology companies should not surprise us. I mean, we've seen it before \u2014 and again, don't take this critically. But we saw a large oil company become a monopoly back in the late 1800s, early 1900s. We saw a large telecommunications company become a near-monopoly in the '60s, '70s and '80s.\n\nAnd, just as Facebook \u2014 and these companies were founded by bright entrepreneurs. Their companies grew. And, eventually, they sometimes became detached from everyday Americans. And what happened is policymakers then had to step in and reestablish the balance between those \u2014 those folks and everyday Americans.\n\nYou didn't intend for this to happen. It did happen, and I appreciate that you've apologized for it. And one of the things I appreciate about Facebook \u2014 it appears you're proactively trying to address the situation.\n\nJust as we addressed those monopolies in the past, we're faced with that similar \u2014 that situation today. We need to \u2014 and this \u2014 this goes beyond Facebook. This has to do with the edge providers. It has to do with social media organizations and also with ISPs.\n\nBack to \u2014 to Facebook in particular, though, we heard examples yesterday, during the Senate hearing, and also today, during this hearing, so far, about ideological bias among the users of Facebook.\n\nIn my Texas district, I have a retired schoolteacher whose conservative postings were banned or stopped. The good news is I was able to work with Facebook's personnel and get her reinstated. That said, the Facebook centers still seem to be trying to stop her postings. And I \u2014 anything you can do in that regard to fix that bias will go a long way.\n\nI want to move a different direction; that's to talk about the future. Congress needs to consider policy responses, as I said earlier. And I want to call this policy response Privacy 2.0 and Fairness 2.0.\n\nWith respect to fairness, I think the technology companies should be ideologically agnostic regarding their users' public-facing activities. The only exception would be for potentially violent behavior.\n\nI'll ask \u2014 my \u2014 my question is, on this, do you agree that Facebook and other technology platforms should be ideologically neutral?",

And I really think you've done a \u2014 a great benefit to Facebook and yourself in particular as we now have heard, without a doubt, Facebook doesn't sell data. I think the narrative would be, of course you sell data. And now we all know across America you don't sell data. I think that's very good for you, a very good clarification.\n\nThe other one is that the whole situation we're here is because a third-party app developer, Aleksandr Kogan, didn't follow through on the rules. He was told he can't sell the data. He gathered the data, and then he did what he's not supposed to and he sold that data. And it's very hard to anticipate a bad actor doing what they're doing until after they've done it, and clearly you took actions after 2014.\n\nSo one real quick question is, what did change in, you know, 10 or 20 or 30 seconds?

So if you and your friend both happen to be playing a game together or on an app that \u2014 listening to music together, then that app could have some information from both of you because you both had signed in and authorized that app. But other than that, people wouldn't be able to share information from their friends.\n\nSo that the basic issue here were 300,000 people used this poll and came \u2014 and the app and then ultimately sold it to Cambridge Analytica and Cambridge Analytica had access to as many as 87 million people's information wouldn't be possible today.

You \u2014 I could tell from the tone, we would say the other side sometimes when we point to our left, but when the representative from Illinois to quote her said, \u201cWho is going to protect us from Facebook?\u201d I mean that threw me back in my chair. I mean, that was certainly an aggressive \u2014 we'll \u2014 we'll use the polite word \u201caggressive,\u201d but I think out of bounds kind of comment. Just my opinion.\n\nAnd I've said I was interviewed by a couple of folks in the break and I said, you know, as I'm listening to you today I'm quite confident that you truly are doing good. You believe in what you're doing. 2.2 billion people are using your platform. And I sincerely know in my heart that you do believe in \u2014 in keeping all ideas equal, and you may vote a certain way or not but that doesn't matter.\n\nYou've got 27,000 employees and I think the fact is that you're operating under a Federal Trade Commission consent decree from 2011. That's a real thing, and it goes for 20 years. So when someone said, do we need more regulations, or do we need more legislation? I said no.\n\nRight now what we have is Facebook with a CEO that \u2014 that's mind is in the right place doing the best you can with 27,000 people, but the consent decree does what it does. I mean, there would be significant financial penalties were Facebook to ignore that consent decree.\n\nSo I think as I'm hearing this meeting going back and forth, I for one think it was beneficial.

So we looked at that and said, hey, this isn't \u2014 this isn't right.\n\nOr we should review these apps and make sure that if an app developer's going to ask someone to access their data that they actually have a reason why they want to access to it.

One is making sure that people have control over how each piece of information that they share used.\n\nSo people should have the ability to know what a company knows about them, to control and have a setting about who can see it and to be able to delete it whenever they want. The second set of things is making sure that people actually understand what the tools are that are available.\n\nSo not just having it in some settings page somewhere, but put the tools in front of people so that they can make a decision. And that both builds trust and makes inside people's experiences are configured in the way that they want.\n\nThat's something that we've done a number of times over the years at Facebook. But with GDPR, we will now be doing more and around the whole world. The third piece is there are some very sensitive technologies that I think are important to enable innovation around like face recognition, but that you want to make sure that you get special consent for.\n\nRight, it's if we \u2014 if we make it too hard for American companies to innovate in areas like facial recognition, then we will lose to Chinese companies and other companies around the world where \u2014 that are able innovate in that.",

Started as a state legislator, used Facebook to communicate with my constituents. And it has been an invaluable tool for me in communicating.\n\nWe can actually do in real time multiple issues as we deal with them in here in Congress, answer questions. It's almost like a town hall in real time. I also want to tell you that your staff here at the Governmental Affairs Office, Chris Herndon and others do a fabulous job in keeping us informed.\n\nSo I want to thank you for that. Before this hearing when we heard about it, we asked our constituents and our friends on Facebook, what would they want me to ask you? And the main response was addressing the perceived, and in many instances confirmed bias and viewpoint discrimination against Christians and conservatives on your platform.\n\nToday, listening to this, I think the two main issues are user privacy and censorship. Constitution of the United States and the First Amendment says, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Nor will they abridge the freedom of speech of the press, the right of people to assemble or address the Congress for address of grievances \u2014 or petition Congress to address for grievances.\u201d I've got a copy of the Constitution I want to give you at the end of this hearing.\n\nThe reason I say all that, this is maybe a rhetorical question but why not have a community standard for free speech and free exercise of religion that is simply a mirror of the First Amendment, with algorithms that are viewed \u2014 that have a viewpoint that is neutral? Why not do that?",

So once you get into that, you're already \u2014 you're deciding that you \u2014 you take this value that you care about safety. And that we don't want people to be able to spread information that can cause harm.\n\nAnd I think that that \u2014 it \u2014 our general responsibility is to \u2014 is to allow the broadest spectrum of free expression as we can ...",

And I believe the Constitution generally applies to government and says that Congress shall make no law respecting \u2014 talks about religion.\n\nAnd then we don't want to bridge the freedom of speech or the press. But the standard has been applied to private businesses, whether those are newspapers or other media platform. And I would argue that social media has now become a media platform to be considered in a lot of ways the same as other press media.\n\nSo I think the First Amendment probably does apply and will apply. What will you do \u2014 and let me ask you this, what will you do to restore the First Amendment rights of Facebook users and ensure that all users are treated equally, regardless of whether they're conservative, moderate, liberal or whatnot?",
