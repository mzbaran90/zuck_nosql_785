People share a whole lot of content and then sometimes there are disputes between people around whether that content is acceptable, whether it\u2019s hate speech or valid political speech; whether it is an organization which is deemed to be a bad or hateful or terrorist organization or one that\u2019s expressing a reasonable point of view.\nI think more than a lot of other companies, we\u2019re in a position where we have to adjudicate those kinds of disputes between different members of our community. And in order to do that, we\u2019ve had to build out a whole set of policies and governance around how that works.\nBut I think it\u2019s actually one of the most interesting philosophical questions that we face. With a community of more than 2 billion people all around the world, in every different country, where there are wildly different social and cultural norms, it\u2019s just not clear to me that us sitting in an office here in California are best placed to always determine what the policies should be for people all around the world. And I\u2019ve been working on and thinking through: How can you set up a more democratic or community-oriented process that reflects the values of people around the world?\nThat\u2019s one of the things that I really think we need to get right. Because I\u2019m just not sure that the current state is a great one.",

One of the things that I feel really lucky we have is this company structure where, at the end of the day, it\u2019s a controlled company. We are not at the whims of short-term shareholders. We can really design these products and decisions with what is going to be in the best interest of the community over time.",

On the one hand, your control of voting shares makes you more insulated from short-term pressures of the market. On the other hand, you have a lot more personal power. There\u2019s no quadrennial election for CEO of Facebook. And that\u2019s a normal way that democratic governments ensure accountability. Do you think that governance structure makes you, in some cases, less accountable?",

            "speaker": "Mark Zuckerberg",

My goal here is to create a governance structure around the content and the community that reflects more what people in the community want than what short-term-oriented shareholders might want. And if we do that well, then I think that could really break ground on governance for an internet community. But if we don\u2019t do it well, then I think we\u2019ll fail to handle a lot of the issues that are coming up.\nHere are a few of the principles. One is transparency. Right now, I don\u2019t think we are transparent enough around the prevalence of different issues on the platform. We haven\u2019t done a good job of publishing and being transparent about the prevalence of those kinds of issues, and the work that we\u2019re doing and the trends of how we\u2019re driving those things down over time.\nA second is some sort of independent appeal process. Right now, if you post something on Facebook and someone reports it and our community operations and review team looks at it and decides that it needs to get taken down, there\u2019s not really a way to appeal that. I think in any kind of good-functioning democratic system, there needs to be a way to appeal. And I think we can build that internally as a first step.\nBut over the long term, what I\u2019d really like to get to is an independent appeal. So maybe folks at Facebook make the first decision based on the community standards that are outlined, and then people can get a second opinion. You can imagine some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don\u2019t work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world.",

Millions. Maybe hundreds of millions.\u201d\nThe problem wasn\u2019t the lack of transparency; it was how to know we could trust what was coming out. And one of the reasons I\u2019m interested to hear you broach the idea of independent institutions is I wonder if part of transparency has to be creating modes of information that are independent.",

            "statement": "Yeah, I think that\u2019s a good point. And I certainly think what you\u2019re saying is a fair criticism. It\u2019s tough to be transparent when we don\u2019t first have a full understanding of where the state of some of the systems [is]. In 2016, we were behind having an understanding and operational excellence on preventing things like misinformation, Russian interference. And you can bet that\u2019s a huge focus for us going forward.\nRight now in the company, I think we have about 14,000 people working on security and community operations and review, just to make sure that we can really nail down some of those issues that we had in 2016.\nAfter the 2016 US elections, a number of months later, there were the French elections. And for that, we spent a bunch of time developing new AI tools to find the kind of fake accounts spreading misinformation and we took down \u2014 I think it was more than 30,000 accounts, and I think the reports out of France were that people felt like that was a much cleaner election on social media.\nA few months later, there were the German elections. And there, we augmented the playbook again to work directly with the election commission in Germany. If you work with the government in a country, they\u2019ll really actually have a fuller understanding of what is going on and what are all the issues that we would need to focus on.\nAnd then fast-forward to last year, 2017, and the special election in Alabama. We deployed a number of new tools that we\u2019d developed to find fake accounts who were trying to spread false news, and we got them off before a lot of the discussion around the election. And again, I think we felt a lot better about the result there.",

If you\u2019re Russia and you get caught hacking into our election systems \u2014 which they also tried to do \u2014 and you fail and Hillary Clinton wins, the consequences of that can be really severe. Sanctions could be tremendous, and you could even imagine something like that escalating into armed conflict.\nIf you do this on Facebook, maybe you get caught and your bots get shut down, but Facebook, in not being a government, really doesn\u2019t have the ability to punish. If Cambridge Analytica messes with everybody\u2019s privacy, you can\u2019t throw them in jail in the way that, if you\u2019re a doctor and you repeatedly violate HIPAA, the government makes sure you face very severe legal consequences. So do you have capacity to do not just detection but sanction? Is there a way to increase the cost of using your platform for these kinds of efforts?",

            "speaker": "Mark Zuckerberg",
            "statement": "I can walk through how we\u2019re basically approaching this.\nThere are three big categories of fake news. There\u2019s a group of people who are like spammers. These are the people who, in pre-social media days, would\u2019ve been sending you Viagra emails. The basic playbook that you want to run on that is just make it non-economical. So the first step, once we realized that this was an issue, was a number of them ran Facebook ads on their webpages. We immediately said, \u201cOkay. Anyone who\u2019s even remotely sketchy, no way are you going to be able to use our tools to monetize.\u201d So the amount of money that they made went down.\nThen they\u2019re trying to pump this content into Facebook with the hopes that people will click on it and see ads and make money. As our systems get better at detecting this, we show the content less, which drives the economic value for them down. Eventually, they just get to a point where they go and do something else.\nThe second category is state actors. That\u2019s basically the Russian interference effort. And that is a security problem. You never fully solve it, but you strengthen your defenses. You get rid of the fake accounts and the tools that they have. We can\u2019t do this all by ourselves, so we try to work with local governments everywhere who have more tools to punish them and have more insight into what is going on across their country so that they can tell us what to focus on. And that one I feel like we\u2019re making good progress on too.\nThen there\u2019s the third category, which is the most nuanced, which are basically real media outlets who are saying what they think is true but have varying levels of accuracy or trustworthiness. And that is actually the most challenging portion of the issue to deal with. Because there, I think, there are quite large free speech issues. Folks are saying stuff that may be wrong, but they mean it, they think they\u2019re speaking their truth, and do you really wanna shut them down for doing that?\nSo we\u2019ve been probably the most careful on that piece. But this year, we\u2019ve rolled out a number of changes to News Feed that try to boost in the ranking broadly trusted news sources. We\u2019ve surveyed people across the whole community and asked them whether they trust different news sources.\nTake the Wall Street Journal or New York Times. Even if not everyone reads them, the people who don\u2019t read them typically still think they\u2019re good, trustworthy journalism. Whereas if you get down to blogs that may be on more of the fringe, they\u2019ll have their strong supporters, but people who don\u2019t necessarily read them often don\u2019t trust them as much.",

One thing I hear when I listen to the third solution there is it also creates a huge return to incumbency.\nIf you\u2019re the New York Times and you\u2019ve been around for a long time and you\u2019re well-known, people trust you. If you\u2019re somebody who wants to begin a media organization two months from now, people don\u2019t know if they can trust you yet. If Facebook is the way people get their news, and the way Facebook ranks its News Feed is by privileging news people already trust, it\u2019s going to be a lot harder for new organizations to break through.",

One of the great things about the internet and the services we\u2019re trying to build, you\u2019re giving everyone a voice. That\u2019s so deep in our mission. We definitely think about that in all the changes that we\u2019re making.\nI think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that of all the strategies that I just laid out, they\u2019re made up of many different actions, which each have relatively subtle effects. So the broadly trusted shift that I just mentioned, it changes how much something might be seen by, I don\u2019t know, just call it in the range of maybe 20 percent.\nWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is make it so that the content that people see is actually really meaningful to them. And one of the things I think we often get criticized for is, and incorrectly in this case, is people say, \u201cHey, you\u2019re just ranking the system based on what people like and click on.\u201d\nThat\u2019s actually not true. We moved past that many years back. There was this issue with clickbait, where there were a bunch of publications that would push content into Facebook, [and] people would click on them because they had sensational titles but then would not feel good about having read that content. So that was one of the first times that those basic metrics around clicks, likes, and comments on the content really stopped working to help us show the most meaningful content.\nThe way that this works today, broadly, is we have panels of hundreds or thousands of people who come in and we show them all the content that their friends and pages who they follow have shared. And we ask them to rank it, and basically say, \u201cWhat were the most meaningful things that you wish were at the top of feed?\u201d\nAnd then we try to design algorithms that just map to what people are actually telling us is meaningful to them. Not what they click on, not what is going to make us the most revenue, but what people actually find meaningful and valuable. So when we\u2019re making shifts \u2014 like the broadly trusted shift \u2014 the reason why we\u2019re doing that is because it actually maps to what people are telling us they want at a deep level.",

Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, gave an interview the other day and he was asked what he would do if he was in your shoes. He said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation,\u201d and argued that Apple sells products to users, it doesn\u2019t sell users to advertisers, and so it\u2019s a sounder business model that doesn\u2019t open itself to these problems.\nDo you think part of the problem here is the business model where attention ends up dominating above all else, and so anything that can engage has powerful value within the ecosystem?",

The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can\u2019t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not primarily focused on serving people. I think probably to the dissatisfaction of our sales team here, I make all of our decisions based on what\u2019s going to matter to our community and focus much less on the advertising side of the business.\nBut if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford. I thought Jeff Bezos had an excellent saying on this in one of his Kindle launches a number of years back. He said, \u201cThere are companies that work hard to charge you more, and there are companies that work hard to charge you less.\u201d And at Facebook, we are squarely in the camp of the companies that work hard to charge you less and provide a free service that everyone can use.\nI don\u2019t think at all that that means that we don\u2019t care about people. To the contrary, I think it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you.

And we were talking about your announcement that some of the changes you\u2019re making have brought down, a little bit, the amount of time people are spending on the platform. And he made the point, \u201cYou know that\u2019s great. But he couldn\u2019t do that by 50 percent. Wall Street would freak out; his board would freak out.\u201d There are costs to this model, and I do wonder how you think about at least protecting yourself against some of them dominating in the long run.",

            "statement": "Well, I think our responsibility here is to make sure that the time people spend on Facebook is time well spent. We don\u2019t have teams who have, as their primary goal, making it so people spend more time. The way I design the goals for the teams is that you try to build the best experience you can. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really right to assume that people spending time on a service is bad. But at the same time, I also think maximizing the time that people spend is not really the goal either.\nIn the last year, we\u2019ve done a lot of research into what drives well-being for people. And what uses of social networks are correlated with happiness and long-term measures of health and all the measures of well-being that you\u2019d expect, and what areas are not as positive.\nAnd the thing we\u2019ve found is that you can break Facebook and social media use into two categories. One is where people are connecting and building relationships, even if it\u2019s subtle, even if it\u2019s just I post a photo and someone I haven\u2019t talked to in a while comments. That person is reminding me that they care about me.\nThe other part of the use is basically content consumption. So that\u2019s watching videos, reading news, passively consuming content in a way where you\u2019re not actually interacting with anyone or building a relationship. And what we find is that the things that are about interacting with people and building relationships end up being correlated with all of the measures of long-term well-being that you\u2019d expect, whereas the things that are primarily just about content consumption, even if they\u2019re informative or entertaining and people say they like them, are not as correlated with long-term measures of well-being.\nSo this is another shift we\u2019ve made in News Feed and our systems this year. We\u2019re prioritizing showing more content from your friends and family first, so that way you\u2019ll be more likely to have interactions that are meaningful to you and that more of the time you\u2019re spending is building those relationships.\nThat change actually took time spent down a little bit. That was part of what I was talking about on that earnings call. But over the long term, even if time spent goes down, if people are spending more time on Facebook actually building relationships with people they care about, then that\u2019s going to build a stronger community and build a stronger business, regardless of what Wall Street thinks about it in the near term.\nJavier Zarracina/Vox; Richard Drew/AP",

Something I\u2019ve seen recently has been a perception at Facebook that a lot of the critical coverage from the media comes from journalists angry that Facebook is decimating the advertising market that journalism depends on. And there is that view. The publisher of Dow Jones, Will Lewis, said that the diversion of advertising dollars into Facebook and Google is killing news and that it has to stop.\nIs he right or wrong? And given that so much of the advertising on Facebook wraps around news that journalism organizations are paying to report and publish, what responsibility do you feel you have to the people creating real news for their business model to work, given that their products create value, not just for the world but for Facebook itself?",

And that\u2019s not just the big traditional institutions, but a big part of what I actually think about when I\u2019m thinking about high-quality journalism is local news. And I think that there are almost two different strategies in terms of how you address that.\nFor the larger institutions, and maybe even some of the smaller ones as well, subscriptions are really a key point on this. I think a lot of these business models are moving toward a higher percentage of subscriptions, where the people who are getting the most value from you are contributing a disproportionate amount to the revenue. And there are certainly a lot of things that we can do on Facebook to help people, to help these news organizations, drive subscriptions. And that\u2019s certainly been a lot of the work that we\u2019ve done and we\u2019ll continue doing.\nIn local news, I think some of the solutions might be a little bit different. But I think it\u2019s easy to lose track of how important this is. There\u2019s been a lot of conversation about civic engagement changing, and I think people can lose sight of how closely tied that can be to local news. In a town with a strong local newspaper, people are much more informed; they\u2019re much more likely to be civically active. On Facebook, we\u2019ve taken steps to show more local news to people. We\u2019re also working with them specifically, creating funds to support them and working on both subscriptions and ads that should hopefully create a more thriving ecosystem.",

You wrote that \u201cprogress now requires humanity coming together, not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community,\u201d and suggested that Facebook could be the social infrastructure for that evolution.\nIn retrospect, I think a key question here has become whether creating infrastructure where all the tensions of countries and ethnicities and regions and ideologies can more easily collide into each other will actually help us become that global community or whether it will further tear us apart.

And there\u2019s been a big rise of isolationism and nationalism that I think threatens the global cooperation that will be required to solve some of the bigger issues, like maintaining peace, addressing climate change, eventually collaborating a lot in accelerating science and curing diseases and eliminating poverty.\nSo this is a huge part of our mission. One of the things I found heartening is if you ask millennials what they identify the most with, it\u2019s not their nationality or even their ethnicity. The plurality identifies as a citizen of the world. And that, I think, reflects the values of where we need to go in order to solve some of these bigger questions.\nSo now the question is how do you do that? I think it\u2019s clear that just helping people connect by itself isn\u2019t always positive. A much bigger part of the focus for me now is making sure that as we\u2019re connecting people, we are helping to build bonds and bring people closer together, rather than just focused on the mechanics of the connection and the infrastructure.\nThere\u2019s a number of different pieces that you need to do here. I think civic society basically starts bottom-up. You need to have well-functioning groups and communities. We\u2019re very focused on that. You need a well-informed citizenry, so we\u2019re very focused on the quality of journalism, that everyone has a voice, and that people can get access to the content they need. That, I think, ends up being really important.\nCivic engagement, both being involved in elections and increasingly working to eliminate interference and different nation-states trying to interfere in each other\u2019s elections, ends up being really important. And then I think part of what we need to do is work on some of the new types of governance questions that we started this conversation off with because there hasn\u2019t been a community like this that has spanned so many different countries.\nSo those are some of the things that I\u2019m focused on. But right now a lot of people aren\u2019t as focused on connecting the world or bringing countries closer together as maybe they were a few years back. And I still view that as an important part of our vision for where the world should go \u2014 that we do what we can to stay committed to that and hopefully can help the world move in that direction.",

Phil Robertson, who\u2019s a deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, made the point that Facebook is dominant for news information in Myanmar but Myanmar is not an incredibly important market for Facebook. It doesn\u2019t get the attention we give things that go wrong in America. I doubt you have a proportionate amount of staff in Myanmar to what you have in America. And he said the result is you end up being like \u201can absentee landlord\u201d in Southeast Asia.\nIs Facebook too big to manage its global scale in some of these other countries, the ones we don\u2019t always talk about in this conversation, effectively?",

But our headquarters is here in California and the vast majority of our community is not even in the US, and it\u2019s a constant challenge to make sure that we\u2019re putting due attention on all of the people in different parts of the community around the world.\nThe Myanmar issues have, I think, gotten a lot of focus inside the company. I remember, one Saturday morning, I got a phone call and we detected that people were trying to spread sensational messages through \u2014 it was Facebook Messenger in this case \u2014 to each side of the conflict, basically telling the Muslims, \u201cHey, there\u2019s about to be an uprising of the Buddhists, so make sure that you are armed and go to this place.\u201d And then the same thing on the other side.\nSo that\u2019s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm. Now, in that case, our systems detect that that\u2019s going on. We stop those messages from going through. But this is certainly something that we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to.",

The idea that \u201canything is possible.\u201d Our sense of what \u201canything\u201d means there has become wider. Or the idea that you want to make the world more open and connected \u2014 I think it\u2019s become clearer that an open and connected world could be a better world or it could be a worse world.\nSo, when you think about the 20-year time frame, what will you be looking for to see if Facebook succeeded, if it actually made the world a better place?",

            "statement": "Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to take 20 years. I think the basic point that you\u2019re getting at is that we\u2019re really idealistic. When we started, we thought about how good it would be if people could connect, if everyone had a voice. Frankly, we didn\u2019t spend enough time investing in, or thinking through, some of the downside uses of the tools. So for the first 10 years of the company, everyone was just focused on the positive.\nI think now people are appropriately focused on some of the risks and downsides as well. And I think we were too slow in investing enough in that. It\u2019s not like we did nothing. I mean, at the beginning of last year, I think we had 10,000 people working on security. But by the end of this year, we\u2019re going to have 20,000 people working on security.\nIn terms of resolving a lot of these issues, I think it\u2019s just a case where because we didn\u2019t invest enough, I think we will dig through this hole, but it will take a few years. I wish I could solve all these issues in three months or six months, but I just think the reality is that solving some of these questions is just going to take a longer period of time.\nNow, the good news there is that we really started investing more, at least a year ago. So if it\u2019s going to be a three-year process, then I think we\u2019re about a year in already. And hopefully, by the end of this year, we\u2019ll have really started to turn the corner on some of these issues.\nBut getting back to your question, I think human nature is generally positive. I\u2019m an optimist in that way. But there\u2019s no doubt that our responsibilities to amplify the good parts of what people can do when they connect, and to mitigate and prevent the bad things that people might do to try to abuse each other.\nAnd over the long term, I think that\u2019s the big question. Have we enabled people to come together in new ways \u2014 whether that\u2019s creating new jobs, creating new businesses, spreading new ideas, promoting a more open discourse, allowing good ideas to spread through society more quickly than they might have otherwise? And on the other side, did we do a good job of preventing the abuse? Of making it so that governments aren\u2019t interfering in each other\u2019s civic elections and processes? Are we eliminating, or at least dramatically reducing, things like hate speech?\nWe\u2019re in the middle of a lot of issues, and I certainly think we could\u2019ve done a better job so far. I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re going to address a lot of those challenges, and that we\u2019ll get through this, and that when you look back five years from now, 10 years from now, people will look at the net effect of being able to connect online and have a voice and share what matters to them as just a massively positive thing in the world.",
