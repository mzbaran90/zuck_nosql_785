        <participant name="Mark Zuckerberg">We just announced our quarterly results and gave an update on our progress building a global community.

Our community now has almost 1.9 billion people, including 1.2 billion people active every day. More than 65 million small businesses use Facebook to connect with their customers.

Our biggest focus continues to be putting video first across our family of apps. More than 150 million people now use Instagram Stories every day. We've launched our new camera in Messenger and have started rolling it out in Facebook as well.

We have a lot more work ahead as we continue building the community we all want -- one that is informed, supportive, safe, and a force for good in the world. Thank you for being a part of this journey to connect the world.</participant>
