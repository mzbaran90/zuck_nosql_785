        <participant name="Mark Zuckerberg">Today Priscilla and I stopped by some local newspapers as we drove through Alabama. The folks there were working hard over President's Day weekend to keep their communities informed.

It seems like a good time to say thank you to all the journalists around the world who work tirelessly and sometimes put their lives in danger to surface the truth.

I don't always agree with everything you say, but that's how democracy is supposed to work. 

I know I join many people in America and across the world in thanking you for your work.</participant>
