        <participant name="Mark Zuckerberg">Heading back home after a great few days in Texas. Today we drove down to Waco and stopped in smaller towns along the way.

I had lunch with community leaders in Waxahachie who shared their pride in their home and their feelings on a divided country. I met young moms in West who moved back to their town because they want their kids to be raised with the same values they grew up with. And I met with ministers in Waco who are helping their congregations find deeper meaning in a changing world.

In many ways, I still don't have a clear sense of Texas. This state is complex, and everyone has a lot of layers -- as Americans, as Texans, as members of a local community, and even just as individuals. But this trip has helped me understand just how important community is, and how we're all just looking for something we can trust.

We may come from different backgrounds, but we all want to find purpose and authenticity in something bigger than ourselves.

Thanks to everyone who has shared their stories with me over the last few days. I'll remember this experience for a very long time.

I'm also starting a page with more photos from my trips. You can see them all at: https://www.facebook.com/YearofTravel</participant>
