        <participant name="Mark Zuckerberg">I wrote this letter exactly five years ago when we announced Facebook's IPO. The letter is an explanation of how I see our community and our role in the world.

Five years later, the world has changed a lot and so have we. I'm almost done writing a new letter about how I see our community and our role evolving, and I'll share it soon.</participant>
